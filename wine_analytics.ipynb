          "evalue": "Could not convert Opens with sweet berry aromas that are inviting yet generic. The palate has plenty of acidity, making this Merlot food-friendly but racy on its own. Flavors of black cherry and dark plums are juicy, and there's a touch of spice and chocolate late.Vanilla and floral aromas have a suspicious artificiality to them, and in the mouth it's a sweet, sugary ride toward a cloying finish.Muddy plum and berry aromas lead to a sharp, rugged palate. Tart plum and pie cherry flavors end raw, rough and bitter.Aromas of rose hips, tomato leaf, raisin and black cherry get this fuller-bodied Pinot going on its way to a chunky palate of ripe raspberry, plum and creamy oak. There's length and a smooth mouthfeel, and it avoids common New World pot holes like faux butter or popcorn-like flavors. Drink now.Composed up front, with floral aromas matching wits with dry herb notes and solid berry fruit scents. The palate is snappy and crisp, with focus and narrow, tight flavors of raspberry and plum blended with vanilla. Bright and juicy throughout, with vanilla and toast on the finish.Fresh, inviting raspberry, strawberry and tempered vanilla aromas set up a snappy, equally fresh palate of cherry and raspberry. There's no excess heft, beef, extract or color to this wine; it's restrained but not miserly. And it finishes crisp and flashy. Well made and likely good with food.Sweet and candied on the nose, with marshmallow, cotton candy, chocolate-dipped cherry and dustiness. The palate has a pure feel and good ripeness, with flavors of herbal berry, toast, coffee and spice. Warm, chocolaty and oaky, with a lasting mocha flavor.Dark as night, with a rich, round, deep nose. Overt on the palate, with cherry, blackberry and plum. Juicy enough, with chewy tannins and firm acidity. Beefy enough to match with any meat and dark enough to substitute for paint. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.Layered aromas of cassis, berry, coffee and mocha come with regional Cafayate green notes. The palate is lively and offers ribald acidity along with red plum, berry, vanilla, spice and toast flavors. Turns more oaky the longer it's open, with vanilla and dill on the finish.Monteviejo, one of the Clos de los Siete wineries, has entered the unofficial “fun Malbec” category with Festivo, which has a stemmy, slightly burnt character that is present from start to finish. Along the way there are leathery black fruit flavors, herbal qualities and a good mouthfeel. Decent wine but decidedly herbal and stemmy.From a 50+-year-old vineyard in La Consulta in the Uco Valley comes this bold, seriously built Malbec. Black cherry and coconut aromas settle in nicely, followed by forward raspberry, mocha and coffee notes. Great acidity, tannic foundation, structure and fillings; it's like a happy house. Drink from 2011 through 2015.Aromas of medicinal cassis and plum show mild latex accents, but the wine is concentrated and solid on the palate, with cola, cassis and black fruit flavors. Medium bodied and fairly long on the palate, with cough drop, cassis and a pretty good feel to the finish. Equal parts Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon.Simple berry aromas are generic. This is dark on the palate, with black-fruit flavors that are standard and don't show much character. A lightly toasted finish is solid and not too choppy.Malbec and Bonarda are the lead grapes in this four-variety blend that shows improvement from the 2004, which was tough. Loads of ripe, dark fruit lead the way, with chewy, dense berry flavors coming next. It's bolstered by warm, oaky hints that settle on mocha and spice, so it fits the familiar style of what is good Mendoza wine.Aromas of prune, raisin and black plum are full and gritty. A chunky full-bodied palate feels grabby, while this tastes of generic blackberry, burnt coffee and dark chocolate. A steady plump, rubbery finish closes the show.Overt oak is the first thing you encounter on the nose, but underneath the heavy wood covering is a polished and sincere wine. The mouth is lively and juicy, with commendable plum and raspberry flavors. And while the finish is sort of basic in its vanilla and chocolate character, it has a nice feel to it. A wine with virtues but maybe a touch too much new oak.A bright purple luster draws you in, and the nose is bright, clean, focused and full of wild blackberry. Balanced in the mouth, with size and tannin but plenty of acidity and fruit. Tastes of blackberry, vanilla cream, molasses and spice, and the finish brings it on home. Sincere and excellent for the price.Smells like a can of green beans, or maybe it's canned peas. Either way, the nose is a siren call of what's to come: celery, acid, lime, asparagus and canned peas. No thank you.Jumpy and leathery at first, although time in the glass settles it down. The palate offers blackberry as the lead flavor, although there's some lemon peel and citrus in the background. Finishes simple and short.Even if this full-bodied Cab starts with some eggy, pastry-like aromas, it soon finds its form. The nose brings char and baked black fruit, while the palate is full of creamy blackberry and brown sugar flavors. Rather rich and ripe, with medium tannins and mild acidity. Drink sooner than later.Roasted berry aromas are stalky at first but come around. This feels round but only marginally structured. Creamy ripe generic flavors of berry and cherry finish solid with some heat.Aggressive lemon-lime aromas are itchy, and the nose turns grassy and green. Overactive in the mouth, and tough to hold on the palate. Just at the level of acceptable; warning signs have been posted.Crisp almost scratchy aromas of herbal red fruits are a bit strained. This feels solid, with ample volume. Earthy flavors of tomato sauce, mixed spices, stewed plum and cassis finish long and herbal, with some grace.A bit sweaty smelling, with pinched grapefruit aromas and distant citrus. The flavors say generic apple and lime, and there's a flatness to it. It's a little sugary as well. OK for a wine with pronounced low acidity.This is La Rural's top line, and before we've been a fan of the Malbec. But this wine has serious balance issues; it's acidic and sour at the core, with heavy oak and not enough flesh. Hails from the cooler Tupungato region, something that's evident in the wine's thin structure.Smells like raspberry or strawberry Kool-Aid, with appropriately “funky” flavors of rhubarb, raspberry and burnt sugar. The mouthfeel is rather scouring and acidic.Round and floral, with melon and other simple, clean aromas. Good mouthfeel, proper acidity and basic, likable flavors of citrus, green apple, green banana and tropical fruits make it a good quaffer and a good value.Tropical and zesty on the nose, with a big shot of lemon blossom and a secondary note of melon. The palate is juicy, fresh and sort of lean, with lemon, pineapple and green apple flavors. Arguably tart and angular, but at least it's clean and crisp.The nose is like a convention of all the food groups: there's bold fruit, grilled meat, cola and even some yeasty toast. The palate is juicy and hits with firm, lively blackberry and boysenberry flavors. And the finish offers continuity between the midpalate and end game. A very nice wine from a consistent winery.In the past this was a Bordeaux blend but now it's all or almost all Malbec. And because it hails from cooler Tupungato it features floral aromas more than heavy berry scents, and in the mouth it's all about red fruit as opposed to beefy black fruit. If it's a bit short on the finish, chalk that up to its racier, more streamlined frame.Dark and dense, with extracted black cherry, leather and earth aromas. Shows a ton of body and darkness but only limited flavors. Chocolate and vanilla appear on the finish, but there's also a blast of green to bring it down. Imported by North American Beverage Group.Heavily toasted and loaded with black cherry and blackberry aromas, this blend of Cabernet, Malbec and Petit Verdot pushes cola, chewy plum and black-fruit flavors. The back end is all about coffee, mocha and bitter chocolate, and as a whole this wine shows Argentina in a fine light.

Bold like Malbec should be, with hints of rubber and latex on the finish.Lightly tropical on the nose, yet nutty and fading on the palate. There's some dried fruit flavors and some acidity to keep it hopping.

Drink now into 2011.Cherry and plum aromas carry the mildest touch of stem, yet the palate is reasonably stocky.

Tropical on the finish, but also slightly bitter. Solid by Mendoza standards but nothing special.Inky aromas of blueberry and boysenberry are a bit collapsed and reduced. Tannic and grabby in the mouth, this tastes of leathery plum and salt. And that saltiness carries onto the finish, which tastes briny and shows tannic grip.Smells resiny and a touch chemical, with cornflakes and vanilla bean notes.

Flavors are pure, modestly oaky and deep in terms of wild berry, coffee and chocolate.Dark, crusty aromas mix with sweet coconut on the nose, while the palate seems lactic and oaky despite fairly pointed acidity. Berry and plum flavors are entirely regular, and the finish is sharp due to the aforementioned acidity. A bit leafy tasting as well.Hard and spiky on the nose, and not a whole lot better in the mouth. The flavors are tart and juicy, while the lean finish is ultratangy and sharp.Granular and syrupy on the nose, and that same thickness of fruit is resurrected on the palate. Gritty on the finish, and sweet and lifeless as a whole.Dense and leathery on the nose, this has aromas of briary berries and a hint of corn/masa. It feels round and textured, with healthy tannins and chewy flavors of blackberry, roasted beef and herb.

Sincere and excellent for the price.Grapey and foxy, with green, minty aromas and a hollow center. The palate is bulky, heavy and tannic, while the flavors are strained and grapey. Sweet and incomplete; grapey but not in harmony.This is Chardonnay with small amounts of Pinot Grigio and Viognier. The nose is nutty, oily and low on fruit. In the mouth, it's racy and citrusy in character. Flavors of orange, papaya and passion fruit are basic, while the finish is fresh and juicy, with tart flavors.Mint and rubber band scents open the bouquet, and then black fruit and marmalade aromas take over. This Bonarda is riper, softer and more cuddly than most, with ultraripe black-fruit flavors and soft tannins that make it borderline sappy. Plump, easygoing and loaded with fruit. Drink now to get the soft, giving side of this grape.Murky, stewy, soupy aromas deliver little to no freshness or fruit, while the palate is tannic and tastes bitter, mildly weedy and minty. Seems roasted and devoid of quality. Unclean and unimpressive.Plenty of patience is required with this wine, because at first it's rough and stewy, with herb and tomato aromas. Airing reveals a blackberry core and tannin-infused oak notes, while the finish features mostly char and vanilla. Has its merits but also some weaknesses.Floral and tropical aromas are a direct reflection of the 75% Torrontés in the blend. There's also lychee, another Torrontés byproduct. Otherwise, it's lean and tangy, with tangerine, lychee and green melon flavors. The more it opens the more it smells like a kitchen cleanser. But the forwardness and snap are admirable. Contains 15% Viognier and 10% Chardonnay.Tons of color, fruit and weight add up to a big, fun but clumsy hunk of generic red wine. With a slightly slick feel and not much structure, it's a wine that's meant to go down easy.Herbal black-fruit aromas come with a lot of oak. This is full, chunky and meaty in feel, with green hints and blackberry flavors appearing before a blast of hickory smoke takes over. A high-toast, slightly bitter finish confirms the strong oaky character.Among the new crop of Patagonian Malbecs, this wine shows a sly style. It's not that full of bells and whistles but it does offer plenty of ripe red fruit such as cassis, cherry and strawberry. Blended in are touches of tobacco and leather. Goes down smooth and easy; registers more lush and ripe than anything. Imported by S&F; Trading Company.Whether it's this single-vineyard Malbec or its partners below (Turcos or Tanos), the characteristics of each are nearly identical: creamy oak, tons of vanilla and milk chocolate, resiny mouthfeels and rich, sweet berry flavors. Pick one or pick them all; they are quasi interchangeable and only time will tell if they show individuality or remain identical triplets.Spicy and woody at first, with tons of black fruit. The nose shows a hint of dill, but for the most part the wine's pure and full of plum, blackberry, vanilla and good tannins. Firm and loaded, with cola on the finish. Yet another success in Trapiche's new line of old-vine, single-vineyard Malbecs. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.Aromas of pickled cabbage and cider are not too attractive, while the palate is surprisingly spritzy and tastes of sweet canned fruit, vanilla and oak dust. Resiny on the finish, with a hint of overripe melon, corn and butter.This new casual wine from Valentin Bianchi is solid with full berry aromas. The palate is round and a little soft and plump, with prune, fig and blackberry flavors. Sweet and easy throughout, with a mild finish. Nothing out of the ordinary.Creamy, bland and short on kick, aromas and flavors. The palate is spongey and tastes of creamed apple, light herbs and white pepper. It's inoffensive but not worth much attention. Finishes a bit vegetal as well.Noemía's signature Malbec, now in its third vintage, is one of the country's best. It starts out herbal and smoky, with a lot of dark French oak. The mouth is powerful and pure, with at least three layers of complex flavors and textures. The fruit is both subtle and loud. Simply an excellent wine of world-class character. Best in 2008–09.Light in color, with transparency, something you usually don't see with Malbec. The nose is rubbery, saucy and a touch grassy, while the palate is tannic and grabby, with stewy, rustic, roasted berry flavors. Finishes with the taste of barbecue sauce.Aromas of baked corn and citrus lead to a sharp, tangy palate that offers lemon and other citrus flavors, but not much heft or sweet fruit to balance things off. Thus it's a razor-sharp and edgy bubbly with lemony sourness all the way through the finish.This driving blend of Malbec with Syrah and Cabernet hails from Argentina's most northern vineyards.Bruising black plum and cassis aromas have mossy, floral sidenotes. It's grapy but not monotone, so you get boysenberry then spice flavors, especially clove. This is toasty on the finish, which has drying tannins.Saturated and extracted, with an incredibly deep purple tint paving the way for manly aromas of espresso, campfire and toasted coconut. The palate, meanwhile, runs a bit sweet, with boysenberry and plum. Soft on the back end, but with enough spine to see it through. For fans of bold reds.This reflects the big, modern style of Mendoza Malbec. The bouquet is ripe and hefty, with coconut, mint, blackberry and almond cookie aromas. Expect thick, rugged tannins along with toasty flavors of black coffee, chocolate and mint. A dark, fruity finish is more subtle and harmonious than specific. Drink through 2018.A rock-solid Malbec with attractive yet simple aromas of black cherry and raspberry. The palate is juicy and fresh, but with enough body to provide a sense of richnes. Forward tasting, with pure berry flavors and a hint of chocolate. The perfect wine for pizza, pasta or grilled meats.Light and lemony aromas blend into lychee scents, while the palate is textured and fairly full, with dry, melony flavors along with green fruit and lychee. Finishes full, with moderate intensity. A quaffing wine to drink now.Dark as night, with shoe polish, coconut and powerful black-fruit aromas. This is jammy, dense, soft and not for aging, but it does deliver a truck load of toasted coffee, blackberry, molasses and crisped brown sugar. Supersweet, rich and made to drink now.This Tempranillo is leafy and leathery, with light raspberry aromas backed by thin plum and berry flavors. It's an aggressive, standard red wine that's neither here nor there.Frenchman Bernard Magrez is building a global brand via high-quality, smartly named wines such as this (La Bienvenida means The Welcoming in Spanish). But the cuteness ends there; this is serious Malbec with maple, leather and coffee aromas in addition to rich berry scents. The palate is integrated and deep, with lively acidity and tannins but enough cuddly fruit to ensure balance. An excellent Argentinean debut for Monsieur Magrez. Imported by Bernard Magrez USA.Aromas of white grapefruit, celery and other prickly fruits lose steam with airing, while the green apple and lime flavors are solid and offer some sweetness. Wet in the mouth, which is what you want, but standard fare as a whole.On one hand you'll find bacon, rubber and smoke aromas, but on the other there's stem and murky notes that bring it down. The palate has sharp acidity and flavors of roasted red berries and pepper. For a Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend, it seems lean, stemmy and wanting.Nicely aromatic, with all that's good about affordable Malbec from Argentina: bold fruit, depth and some richness. The palate is plump and stocked with tasty blackberry, plum and raisin flavors, while the finish is sturdy and subtle. A good wine that should not offend anyone.Black fruit and a hint of tire rubber work the nose, and that's backed up by raspberry and sweet vanilla flavors. This wine is pretty good overall, with depth and push, but it's also a bit starchy and slightly green at its core.Powerfully oaked but awkward, with bruising aromas of fresh-cut wood, sawdust and campfire smoke. Amid the woodiness and thick body you'll find roasted plum and berry flavors, but on the finish resin reappears and lingers. Tastes too saucy and resiny to be called “clean.”Unus is 70% Malbec and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, but what you need to know is that it's 100% excellent. The nose features a rich blend of tobacco, baked plum and leather, while the palate is saturated, concentrated and tastes of cassis and blackberry. Clean, intense and complexHere's another success from Bodega Norton. The nose is rich and big, with crusty chocolate and coconut aromas. More chocolate blends with blackberry and pepper in the mouth, while on the finish there's sexy layered darkness. It's New World pomp and pleasantness in all its glory.Hot and rubbery on the nose, and while it doesn't smell bad it doesn't persuade you to go further. The palate has size, but it's not smooth as the acids dominate. And the flavors of berry and cherry are generic and almost impossible to identify as Syrah. Forgettable wine with tartness.Smells candied and gummy, with sweet, stewy red-berry aromas along with carob. The palate is fairly full and tannic, with cooked, herbal berry flavors that carry over onto the finish, which folds in coffee and grabby tannins. Good enough but sort of stewed and candied.Citrus, acacia blossom and patchouli oil give this an interesting and true-to-Cafayate bouquet. The palate delivers a shot of lychee fruit along with   tangerine and melon, with lemon meringue pie to finish. One of Argentina's better Torrontes; drink now.Complete but not overly exciting. The nose has Malbec's basic black fruit and spice components, while the palate is a little high in acidity and sharpness, but also shows buttery oak and blackberry fruit. Fruity but oaky, with some excess tart acidity on the finish.Lightly baked and sweet on the nose, which draws you in. The palate is brighter and more austere, with sheer, slightly bland cherry and raspberry flavors. Fresh, clean and bouncy on the finish, but never does it turn the corner toward greater complexity or quality. Good to average overall.Generic at best, with lemon and pool water aromas that aren't about to stir many smiles. The palate is flat almost to the point of mushy, with dull lychee and green apple flavors.An opening of lightly baked black fruit aromas and graham cracker is pleasant and ready, while the palate has size, a cushioned feel and herbal, spicy berry flavors and a swatch of oak on the back end. With oak and toast on the finish, it comes to a nice conclusion. Good Malbec with some pedigree.One of Altocedro's better efforts starts with meaty, ripe, chunky black fruit aromas and a wave of mocha, cocoa and berry syrup. It's a creamy specimen but has enough acidity and vitality to not run flat. Mocha, carob and plum extend through the finish. Drink now.Dark aromas suggest shoe polish and roasted black fruits. This feels rubbery and chunky, while the flavor profile includes quick pokes of cherry, plum and rubbery berry before a salty-tasting finish.Light and red in style, with food-friendly acidity and good overall balance and presence. Has sheer qualities and crisp fruit flavors, but it's not sour or too edgy. Smells like Pinot and tastes like it, too.Not bad for basic Argentine Chardonnay. The nose has banana and tropical fruit aromas to go with dried hay, while the soft-bodied palate has enough acidity to keep it flowing. Flavors of melon, banana and vanilla are solid even though it flattens out and shows mild bitterness on the finish.Earthy and deep from head to tail. The nose offers fresh compost, loamy berry, cola and overriding richness. Feels smooth and layered across the palate, with dark berry, pepper and bitter chocolate flavors. Blackened on the finish and toasty; 50% Malbec with four additional Bordeaux varieties.A bit jumbled and certainly it goes heavy on the oak. But as things settle you'll find buttery vanilla notes accenting relatively solid berry fruit. The end result is pretty good. Give it some air.Here's a crisp by-the-glass style of Pinot that's bringing good cherry and raspberry aromas, mild spice notes, and then a firm but lean body with plenty of acidity to propel crisp, cutting flavors of red plum and tart berry. Light and sheering but not sour or too thin.There aren't many Argentine Sauvignon Blancs that make a statement, so this is commendable for showing a lightly citric and minerally nose in front of fresh, citrusy flavors of lime, tangerine and grapefruit. More friendly and easygoing than intense or pungent, it fades quick and easy on the finish.Fairly herbal, with burnt briar aromas that cause it to tilt toward acrid. The palate shows mostly tart cranberry and wild berry flavors, and while it looks dark to the eye, the wine is surprisingly shallow and a little bit sharp in the end run.Brilliantly colored, with dynamite concentration and lovely black fruit and earthy aromas. Precise on the palate but also big and muscular, with silky tannins, grip and a late rush of deftly applied French oak. Delicious and a fine reflection of the Uco Valley, Argentina's top Malbec region.Clean and tropical, and not too heavy, oily or chunky. The nose is pure lemon, pear and apple, while the flavor profile revolves around citrus, apple and honey in the center. Finishes sweeter than it starts, but with dry papaya for balance. Good everyday Chardonnay from Argentina, something we don't see too often.Smoky and rubbery smelling, with brambly, mildly stemmy fruit aromas. The palate is plummy and red in character, with herbal raspberry on the back side. Dry, tangy and herbal on the finish; adequate at best as a whole, even at $9.Roasted and rubbery on first take, with aromas of leather, beefy blackberry and a pinch of herbal juniper and sharpness. The palate is racy and flows well, with lightly herbal flavors of red plum, raspberry and leather. Long on the finish, with a juicy feel.Heavily coated with coconut and oiled leather aromas, however, the palate recedes to Bonarda's typical angularity. The flavors of blackberry and cherry are solid, but the mouthfeel runs rough and sheer. And it finishes with some saltiness and leather. A good wine, not without its fault.Full and inviting up front, with hickory and leather in addition to dark-fruit aromas. This is a collaboration between two Italian buddies and the wine features black cherry and plum flavors but also rather grabby, heavy tannins. It's ultimately chewy and a bit hard, but still it's eminently satisfying.Heavy hayfield aromas are oxidized, and the flavors of almond peel, citrus pith and baked banana do nothing to impress. Not a fresh or healthy wine, if it ever was. Past its prime.A heady wine with mocha, chocolate, balsamic notes and black fruit on the bouquet. At first it seems thick and dumbed down, but it opens up to display bold berry flavors, stewed fruit, chocolate and savory accents. It's just lively enough, but overall this ranks as a saturated, bulky, round wine that falls squarely into the category of New World and ripe.Aggressive lemon-lime aromas are itchy, and the nose turns grassy and green. Overactive in the mouth, and tough to hold on the palate. Just at the level of acceptable; warning signs have been posted.Earth and leather aromas give it some personality, while violet, plum and blackberry form the base of the bouquet. The mouth is a touch rough and drying, but it houses both red and black fruit flavors along with chocolate. Lighter in weight than its Mendoza competition, but that's Patagonia in a nutshell.Basic cherry and raspberry aromas have a candied tone to them, yet the palate is zesty and tart, with linear raspberry flavors that are crisp and finish like a red-fruit sucking candy. A lot of acidity and not much body. Decent but stretched thin.Fairly dense on the nose, with aromas of coffee grounds, leather and beef stew along with berry fruit. The palate is true, with plum and brambly berry flavors. However, the feel is a bit choppy due to sharp acidity. A good blend that will do well with food.Jammy red-fruit aromas mixed with buttery oak make for a simple, sappy nose. There's more butter on the palate in addition to solid blackberry flavors. It finishes round but short, with yet another wave of barrel. A very good wine but not one that wows.Powerful but reduced, with gritty berry aromas and a ton of clove on the nose. There's a carry over of the clove in the mouth, and also roasted fruit flavors, wood spice and sweetness. Powerful for sure, but arguably a bit too woody for its own good.Big and purple, with ripe aromas of black fruits and bacon. The mouth is filling and full, with oaky blackberry, coffee and mildly roasted flavors. Turns more lush and soft on the finish, which is long and tastes of fig paste and prunes. Gets it done for the most part.Dark in color and that's backed up by deep earthy aromas and black fruit. In the mouth it's full and sweet, with baked fruit, chocolate and coffee flavors. Finishes with rich berry and molasses notes, and for a candied, sweet-styled Cabernet it gets the job done.Sol Huarpe's top wine, Xumek, has style and saucy sass. It's not just cookie-cutter ripe and rich, but instead shows herbs, mushroom and also ample black plum and berry flavors. In general it's nice for those seeking a touch more from their Argentinean Malbec. And it hails from lesser-known San Juan and not Mendoza, which may explain its unusual characteristics.Starts out smoky and seemingly ripe, but the nose is the best part. The palate, by contrast, is tight, gritty and the flavors are awkward at best. Really not that consistent and loses focus the more you get into it. Imported by Freixenet USA.Light, clean aromas of melon and vanilla are pleasant and don't overpower. The palate is lucid and medium in weight, with green melon and ripe apple flavors. Lime and green apple carry the finish. Works well; drink immediately.Big, lush and tightly structured, with cola and mocha aromas along with serious black fruit power and brightness. A pure and delicious Malbec-Cabernet wine with the full allotment of berry character, cola accents, dark spice and clarity. Drink now through 2014.Jammy and saturated, with ripe plum, berry and tar aromas. It's fairly sweet and hedonistic in the mouth, but with enough pulsing acidity to keep things in balance. Smoky, racy and juicy on the back palate; this is one of the better Salentein wines we've tried lately.Overtly floral and jumpy, with potent aromas of perfume. Heavy in the mouth, with odd, bland flavors of applesauce and spice. Soft and sticky.Opens with hard, rubbery, leathery aromas. In the mouth, it's thick and chewy with black fruit but also an herbal edge. There's depth and plenty of oak here, and it finishes sweet and relatively smooth. Starts rough, improves in the middle, and then finishes fairly well.This overoaked Malbec smells almost entirely of clove and chocolate. It's bulky and creamy in feel, with bland, stewy berry flavors and a blanket of oaky clove. Oak spice and heat control the finish.This Malbec-Tempranillo blend is trying to be one of those new-wave super bruisers and it achieves that goal, but only to a point. It's big, round, savory and lush, but it's shallow in the midsection because it lacks acidity and punch. Beefy but incomplete. Imported by Winesellers Ltd.From longtime Catena winemakers Mariano de Paola and Pepe Galante, this is a deep, black-fruited Malbec with a cushioned bouquet, violet notes and delightful blackberry character.

Drink now.Floral, sweet and powdery smelling, but pleasant. The palate is light and airy, with hardly any punch or kick. But that serves it well, and amid the sheets there's lime, green-apple notes and tropical shadings. Not bad for the price.Chakana has put out many good wines in recent vintages but this rough and tumble blend of Malbec, Bonarda and Syrah  comes across minty and forced on the nose and then grating on the palate. Yes, it's got color and power. But it lacks the balance and body that you'd expect. Frankly, it seems acidified.Flat and basic, with charred secondary aromas.

Expect better in 2005.Here's a basic Malbec with ripe plum aromas topped off by milk chocolate and vanilla notes. It's hard but bold in the mouth, with decent acidity and a forced set of oaky, chocolaty, berry flavors.Deep, lush aromas of black fruits, graphite and coconut are welcoming and friendly. The mouthfeel is pure and smooth, with elegance and power. Flavors of cassis, blackberry, hard spices and licorice filter into a long, mellow, classy finish. This is a pushy, full-bodied wine that doesn't throw punches; drink through 2020.Attractive and well put together from start to finish. This Cab (with 15% Malbec) is jammed with cassis, raspberry and other juicy berry flavors, while the lushness of the wine rolls over your palate with ease. It's not easy to find Cabernet this good in the $20 range, so get after this one while it's under the radar.Leafy aromas of tomato and green herbs pile on the pyrazines. This distinctly herbal Cabernet is full and chunky in feel, with flavors that follow the nose: bell pepper and spicy tomato lead the way. A peppery finish is herbal to the last note.Like most inexpensive Malbecs, there are some strained aromas here: tire rubber, stemmy fruit and cranberry. But in the mouth it has good body and grab, with roasted fruit flavors and a touch of hickory. Savory and pretty good for under $10.Giant and black, with extracted but pruney aromas that are sweet and raisiny. The palate is chunky, with raisin, fig and black plum flavors. Sweet but falls flat on the finish; has its good qualities but frankly it's an overripe wine.Rubbery and warm on the nose, with earthy plum and blackberry aromas. The palate is full and bouncy, with appropriate plum, berry and cassis flavors. Nice for standard New World Cab, with fig, chocolate and no buttery, sloppy oak.Intense, saturated and well balanced, with touches of motor oil, earth and herbs on the nose. The palate is flush and mouthfilling, with proper tannic bite, fine acidity and stylish flavors of blackberry and raspberry.This smells like a forest fire, but it's also creamy and roasted. Tangy and tart, this features narrow plum and cherry flavors that are powered by blazing acidity.Dry and full of savory plum and spice aromas. With zesty and developed raspberry and cherry flavors along with a mostly fresh and balanced mouthfeel, this is a pretty good bargain Merlot.Lightly tropical to begin with, then more sheering and acidic in the mouth, with high-toned, jacked-up flavors of green apple, pineapple and lemon. Quite snappy and fresh, with an aggressive but true and correct finish.Too funky, animal and vegetal to recommend. The wine has color and size but the aromas and flavors just aren't that pleasant. Tastes more like rhubarb and carob than fresh berries.A big drop off from prior years, probably due to the cold harvest conditions of 2008. Smells minty and lactic, with hard spice and distant fruit aromas. Feels closed, tannic and clipped, with narrow berry flavors and green notes. Toasty on the finish, but also clacky feeling. Good relative to other wines, but not at $70.Fairly brambly and a little sour on the bouquet, with prickly fruit aromas. The palate is just as sharp and angular, without much cushion to fall back on. Flavors of cherry and raspberry are slightly herbal and tart, while the finish is more of the same. Not as round and ripe as you'd expect for an $18 Malbec.This new wine from Donald Hess of the Hess Collection is a big, bold mix of black cherry and currants. It's ripe and cushioned by full tannins and a lot of spirit. The blend is 66% Malbec, 20% Cabernet and 14% Tannat from high-altitude vineyards in Salta. Will go nicely with steak and other meat dishes. A truly excellent, modern-styled Argentine red.Full and fruity, with a dusty edge to the nose and accents of black pepper. Fairly thick and textured on the palate, with a freshness of fruit that works well on the palate. Blackberry, licorice and floral elements all add to the wine's appeal.Dark and heavily oaked on first blush, but give it time to unwind or let it sit in the bottle for a year or two and this will satisfy any Malbec lover. Early on, it's dense and full of shoe polish, mint and coconut; later it spreads out to show sweet dark-berry flavors and finally a rich, almost sticky finish of woodspice, brown sugar and lushness.Exotic aromas of wild berries, cumin and other Middle Eastern spices are interesting and inviting. This feels thick and chewy, bordering on syrupy, with stewed plum and brown sugar flavors. It hits with some burn and heat on the bullish finish.Leather, dark fruit and citrus peel make for a good nose, while the palate is meaty and a bit heavy as it pours on those classic dark-fruit flavors that Malbec is known for. Best to get at this one now because neither the palate nor the finish shows much acidity. A touch hollow.Earthy and mildly lactic on the nose, with tight, lean, herbal flavors. Doesn't rise above mediocre.This is heady but flat on the nose, with soft, oak-driven aromas of baked apple and toffee. It feels plump yet alive due to good acidity, while the flavor profile is steered by the barrel, leaving notes of toasty apple and walnut. A good wine but one that really piles on the oak and resin.There's a sweet center to the bouquet, but surrounding it are more complex notes of mushroom, rubber and roast meat. The palate features ripe, clean blackberry and cassis flavors, while the finish shows piercing tannins. Shows some weight and tannic build-up at this point; drink now and into '09.Wines like this have defined and propelled Malbec mania. It's ripe, bold and firm, with welcoming berry aromas and a powerful but healthy palate of ripped black cherry, berry and cola flavors. In the mix and on the finish you'll find coffee and mocha. Drink now and over the next two years.Warm and earthy, with a touch of sulfur that subsides with air. The palate is juicy but also sort of rich, and the flavors of mixed red fruits feature a couple of layers of potency that are followed by a compact, medium-length finish.If the color doesn't tell the full story, the nose will: it's impeccably perfumed, round and sweet, with amazing fruit aromas and a toasty background. The feel is as lush and rich as they come, and there's outstanding purity to the lusty black fruit flavors. A masher with elegance. Maybe the best Malbec Argentina has ever produced. Drink from 2011–15.Hot and earthy up front, with mocha-like aromas. The palate and finish are syrupy, and the wine ends in a pool of chocolate and berry extract. This is an example of why Argentine Syrah has not found its groove.Aromas of apple cider are a touch acrid, while the palate is wet and easy but low in acidity. Flavors of melon and white fruits show some bitterness and break up in front of a flat finish.Smells murky, leafy and of compost. The palate is lean, dry and slightly rough, with green herb, tomato and light raspberry and strawberry flavors. Finishes herbal and tea-like, with more earthiness than clarity.Clos de los Siete, the amalgmated product of Michel Rolland's Uco Valley wine commune, is rich, round and ripe, with deep aromas and trimmings like polished oak and minerality. The wine is proper, medium to full in size, and full of blackberry, plum and cocoa. No hiccups, pure fruit and complexity make this stellar for the price.Buttercup and lemon aromas may not be overpowering but they are true to the variety. The flavors of melon and preserved tropical fruits work on the wine's fuller-bodied, almost creamy frame. Finishes warm but peachy, with an oily texture. Drink right away.The nose kicks off with ripe apple and zest and draws you in. The palate is live-wire pineapple and green apple with plenty of tang and a worthy mouthfeel. Even on the finish it holds the line.This is prickly and spicy on first take, followed by an aromatic wave of ripe berry and tobacco. It feels jammy and almost heavy, with creamy, milkshake flavors of blackberry, vanilla and cream, and a warm, Port-like finish. A blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot and 20%; drink now–2014.Starts out murky and sweaty, before showing cola, green herbs and leather. It's a rather jumpy, scattershot wine with plum and boysenberry flavors and a grapy, flush finish. The feeling here is that Terrazas wines were more consistent and elevated a few years ago.Slightly carbonic and gassy at first, with huge candied fruit aromas. But quickly the wine settles, and out comes sweet blackberry flavors and some gumminess. It's a chunky, easy wine with medium tannins and modest plushness, which is something you shouldn't necessarily expect from a value-positioned wine. Short on the finish, but plump and buttery.Strange smelling, with aromas of exotic spices, blueberry and some other notes that don't come across that well. Feels solid and chunky, with herbal, sweet flavors that culminate in a dry, rubbery, herbal-tasting finish.By far the best wine in the El Fogón lineup is this Torrontes. The nose is clean and harmonious, with light flower blossom scents. A citrusy mix blends with both apple and pear fruit on the palate, and the finish is clean, if a bit sweet (residual sugar?). Drink as soon as possible.Jammy and raisiny on the nose, but it also has fresh black-fruit and mocha notes that prevent the nose from seeming soft. This feels concentrated and jammy, with maple, mocha, blackberry and oak-influenced flavors. The rich, oak-driven finish shows even more notes of mocha, coffee and chocolate. Candy in a glass, but with structure.Lightly candied at first, but airing unveils more pure plum and raspberry aromas. Cherry, raspberry and plum flavors are standard but good, while the mouthfeel is firm and smooth enough. Mainstream all the way but likable.Opens with apple and buttercup aromas that are encouraging, but the palate falls off. It's wet but shows no definition or fruit. Creamy and generic in the mouth, and ultimately it doesn't go anywhere besides being plump and loaded with vanilla.Bright purple in color, a sure indicator that what's to come will be jammy and rich. The nose is all boysenberry and wood, with a hint of mineral. The palate is ultraripe but a bit clumsy and oversized. Not complex but very nice in a fruit-forward, knife-and-fork manner.Warm and earthy, with a touch of sulfur that subsides with air. The palate is juicy but also sort of rich, and the flavors of mixed red fruits feature a couple of layers of potency that are followed by a compact, medium-length finish.A touch cooked and oaky, but with a sweet, friendly side, too. The palate rests on beefy fruit, and it's chewable and just slightly herbal in nature. Finishes leathery and tannic, with chocolate and coffee notes. Imported by Pernod Ricard, USA.Deep, lush aromas of black fruits, graphite and coconut are welcoming and friendly. The mouthfeel is pure and smooth, with elegance and power. Flavors of cassis, blackberry, hard spices and licorice filter into a long, mellow, classy finish. This is a pushy, full-bodied wine that doesn't throw punches; drink through 2020.Full and overly chunky, but ultimately off-kilter. Too sweet and gummy.A hot and fiery wine from San Juan province that mixes stewy barnyard aromas with black cherry. The palate has a syrupy, sugary feel and medicinal, creamy, baked berry flavors. Peppery on the finish, but with a medicinal aftertaste.From La Rioja, this Torrontés is quiet and neutral. It offers a little tangerine on the nose, and then acceptable but unexciting banana and pear flavors. Overall it's decent but bland.Raisiny aromas lack freshness and lift. Following that lead, this Cabernet feels stewy and heavy, with questionable balance. Herbal flavors of stewed plum and tomato finish chunky and choppy.A wine that's seriously muscled up with tannin and oak. That's what you get with this rugged Argentinean Cabernet that comes with leafy notes of tobacco and mint along with raspy, grippy berry fruit. Maybe another year in bottle will help; now it's not that pleasant.Light, semisweet aromas of cherry show a modest level of concentration, while the palate is a bit rubbery and delivers good but regular cola and cassis flavors. There's a wave of milk chocolate to the fairly smooth but basic finish, and overall it's fine but doesn't get you excited. Only 250 cases made. to numeric",

The palate has plenty of acidity, making this Merlot food-friendly but racy on its own. Flavors of black cherry and dark plums are juicy, and there's a touch of spice and chocolate late.Vanilla and floral aromas have a suspicious artificiality to them, and in the mouth it's a sweet, sugary ride toward a cloying finish.Muddy plum and berry aromas lead to a sharp, rugged palate. Tart plum and pie cherry flavors end raw, rough and bitter.Aromas of rose hips, tomato leaf, raisin and black cherry get this fuller-bodied Pinot going on its way to a chunky palate of ripe raspberry, plum and creamy oak. There's length and a smooth mouthfeel, and it avoids common New World pot holes like faux butter or popcorn-like flavors. Drink now.Composed up front, with floral aromas matching wits with dry herb notes and solid berry fruit scents. The palate is snappy and crisp, with focus and narrow, tight flavors of raspberry and plum blended with vanilla. Bright and juicy throughout, with vanilla and toast on the finish.Fresh, inviting raspberry, strawberry and tempered vanilla aromas set up a snappy, equally fresh palate of cherry and raspberry. There's no excess heft, beef, extract or color to this wine; it's restrained but not miserly. And it finishes crisp and flashy. Well made and likely good with food.Sweet and candied on the nose, with marshmallow, cotton candy, chocolate-dipped cherry and dustiness. The palate has a pure feel and good ripeness, with flavors of herbal berry, toast, coffee and spice. Warm, chocolaty and oaky, with a lasting mocha flavor.Dark as night, with a rich, round, deep nose. Overt on the palate, with cherry, blackberry and plum. Juicy enough, with chewy tannins and firm acidity. Beefy enough to match with any meat and dark enough to substitute for paint. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.Layered aromas of cassis, berry, coffee and mocha come with regional Cafayate green notes. The palate is lively and offers ribald acidity along with red plum, berry, vanilla, spice and toast flavors. Turns more oaky the longer it's open, with vanilla and dill on the finish.Monteviejo, one of the Clos de los Siete wineries, has entered the unofficial “fun Malbec” category with Festivo, which has a stemmy, slightly burnt character that is present from start to finish. Along the way there are leathery black fruit flavors, herbal qualities and a good mouthfeel. Decent wine but decidedly herbal and stemmy.From a 50+-year-old vineyard in La Consulta in the Uco Valley comes this bold, seriously built Malbec. Black cherry and coconut aromas settle in nicely, followed by forward raspberry, mocha and coffee notes. Great acidity, tannic foundation, structure and fillings; it's like a happy house. Drink from 2011 through 2015.Aromas of medicinal cassis and plum show mild latex accents, but the wine is concentrated and solid on the palate, with cola, cassis and black fruit flavors. Medium bodied and fairly long on the palate, with cough drop, cassis and a pretty good feel to the finish. Equal parts Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon.Simple berry aromas are generic. This is dark on the palate, with black-fruit flavors that are standard and don't show much character. A lightly toasted finish is solid and not too choppy.Malbec and Bonarda are the lead grapes in this four-variety blend that shows improvement from the 2004, which was tough. Loads of ripe, dark fruit lead the way, with chewy, dense berry flavors coming next. It's bolstered by warm, oaky hints that settle on mocha and spice, so it fits the familiar style of what is good Mendoza wine.Aromas of prune, raisin and black plum are full and gritty. A chunky full-bodied palate feels grabby, while this tastes of generic blackberry, burnt coffee and dark chocolate. A steady plump, rubbery finish closes the show.Overt oak is the first thing you encounter on the nose, but underneath the heavy wood covering is a polished and sincere wine. The mouth is lively and juicy, with commendable plum and raspberry flavors. And while the finish is sort of basic in its vanilla and chocolate character, it has a nice feel to it. A wine with virtues but maybe a touch too much new oak.A bright purple luster draws you in, and the nose is bright, clean, focused and full of wild blackberry. Balanced in the mouth, with size and tannin but plenty of acidity and fruit. Tastes of blackberry, vanilla cream, molasses and spice, and the finish brings it on home. Sincere and excellent for the price.Smells like a can of green beans, or maybe it's canned peas. Either way, the nose is a siren call of what's to come: celery, acid, lime, asparagus and canned peas. No thank you.Jumpy and leathery at first, although time in the glass settles it down. The palate offers blackberry as the lead flavor, although there's some lemon peel and citrus in the background. Finishes simple and short.Even if this full-bodied Cab starts with some eggy, pastry-like aromas, it soon finds its form. The nose brings char and baked black fruit, while the palate is full of creamy blackberry and brown sugar flavors. Rather rich and ripe, with medium tannins and mild acidity. Drink sooner than later.Roasted berry aromas are stalky at first but come around. This feels round but only marginally structured. Creamy ripe generic flavors of berry and cherry finish solid with some heat.Aggressive lemon-lime aromas are itchy, and the nose turns grassy and green. Overactive in the mouth, and tough to hold on the palate. Just at the level of acceptable; warning signs have been posted.Crisp almost scratchy aromas of herbal red fruits are a bit strained. This feels solid, with ample volume. Earthy flavors of tomato sauce, mixed spices, stewed plum and cassis finish long and herbal, with some grace.A bit sweaty smelling, with pinched grapefruit aromas and distant citrus. The flavors say generic apple and lime, and there's a flatness to it. It's a little sugary as well. OK for a wine with pronounced low acidity.This is La Rural's top line, and before we've been a fan of the Malbec. But this wine has serious balance issues; it's acidic and sour at the core, with heavy oak and not enough flesh. Hails from the cooler Tupungato region, something that's evident in the wine's thin structure.Smells like raspberry or strawberry Kool-Aid, with appropriately “funky” flavors of rhubarb, raspberry and burnt sugar. The mouthfeel is rather scouring and acidic.Round and floral, with melon and other simple, clean aromas. Good mouthfeel, proper acidity and basic, likable flavors of citrus, green apple, green banana and tropical fruits make it a good quaffer and a good value.Tropical and zesty on the nose, with a big shot of lemon blossom and a secondary note of melon. The palate is juicy, fresh and sort of lean, with lemon, pineapple and green apple flavors. Arguably tart and angular, but at least it's clean and crisp.The nose is like a convention of all the food groups: there's bold fruit, grilled meat, cola and even some yeasty toast. The palate is juicy and hits with firm, lively blackberry and boysenberry flavors. And the finish offers continuity between the midpalate and end game. A very nice wine from a consistent winery.In the past this was a Bordeaux blend but now it's all or almost all Malbec. And because it hails from cooler Tupungato it features floral aromas more than heavy berry scents, and in the mouth it's all about red fruit as opposed to beefy black fruit. If it's a bit short on the finish, chalk that up to its racier, more streamlined frame.Dark and dense, with extracted black cherry, leather and earth aromas. Shows a ton of body and darkness but only limited flavors. Chocolate and vanilla appear on the finish, but there's also a blast of green to bring it down. Imported by North American Beverage Group.Heavily toasted and loaded with black cherry and blackberry aromas, this blend of Cabernet, Malbec and Petit Verdot pushes cola, chewy plum and black-fruit flavors. The back end is all about coffee, mocha and bitter chocolate, and as a whole this wine shows Argentina in a fine light. As for the winery, Chakana almost always gets it right.Tapiz's best wine to date, and the first one to shoot higher than the basic or reserve level. Aromas of fresh balsam wood, ripe blackberry and cola are clean and deep. Feels just right, with rich, rewarding flavors of molten berry, chocolate and coffee. Finishes warm, toasty and with focus. Has it all; drink now through 2015.This smells rubbery, with oaky spice, but airing allows it to expand across a lively palate. Herbal, spicy red-berry flavors are strongest in the midpalate, while peppery flavors, rubbery tannins and scratchiness define the finish.Smooth, earthy, lightly herbal aromas are balanced by fresh red-berry notes. This feels racy and lean in the mouth, with nothing fat or grabby getting in the way of steady raspberry, plum and herbal flavors. A note of olive and leafy green rises up on the finish.Generic black-fruit aromas are bolstered by chocolate and char, while the palate throws up extraripe cassis and blackberry flavors. The palate shows good acidity and ample body, and while the tannins come across hard on the finish, food will help it along.Red-fruit aromas of plum and berry are earthy and a bit stalky. The palate is tight, narrow and crisp more than flush. Spice, a touch of green herbs and then raspberry and plum flavors finish herbal, spicy and drying in feel.This appears light and rusty in the glass, with a distant aroma of floral cherry and not much more. It feels sheer and fresh, with fiery red-fruit flavors of cranberry and plum. Fades away with acidity and a juicy strawberry note.A well-made everyday Malbec that gets it done in all ways. Smells nice and floral, with bold, smooth berry aromas. The palate is fresh and lively, with juicy berry flavors, controlled creamy oak notes and spice. Clean on the finish, and a pleasure to drink.Heavily vegetal and unclean on the nose, then pickled on the palate, as in sauerkraut. The only thing saving this from the flusher is decent body weight and mouthfeel.After a few years of stumbling around in Mendoza, this Concha y Toro project seems to have found its way. This wine, albeit oaky, is full of dark fruit, dill and toast aromas. The palate is balanced and tight, with firm tannins and plenty of black cherry, plum and coffee flavors. Toasty and lasting. Shows a lot of power and purity.A little bit hickory-dominated on the bouquet, but also giving balsamic notes, blackberry and chocolate mint. The palate is linear due to a streak of cutting acidity, while the palate is also snappy with wild raspberry and bright plum flavors and plenty of wood tannin. A toasty finish with espresso and chocolate is fine and long. Drink now through 2017.Funky at first and simply not as smooth, pure and clean as Catena's Nicasia and Adrianna Malbecs, which are the components of this wine. Argentino in 2007 is deep and dark like always, with coconut and cassis aromas preceding a sweet, ultrarich palate that's teetering on candied. Quite oaky and chocolaty as well, with brown sugar and depth to the finish. Drink now through 2014.Robust, deep and candied on the nose, with rooty richness, medicinal notes and complexity. The palate is smooth, meaty, healthy and suave, with lush black fruit, prune and earthy flavors. Long, likable and showing a lot of depth and structure. Drink now through 2014.Chunky, ripe and fruity, with bacon and roasted berry aromas. The palate has a good feel and tannins that melt away, while the flavors of black cherry and cassis lean toward medicinal but don't fully go there. Bold like Malbec should be, with hints of rubber and latex on the finish.Lightly tropical on the nose, yet nutty and fading on the palate. There's some dried fruit flavors and some acidity to keep it hopping. But in the grand scheme of things this doesn't come close to taking over center stage.Dry, leafy, spicy aromas have a perfumed accent. A pushy, forward-feeling palate houses similar oaky flavors of cherry. On the finish, it turns woody, with resiny flavors and drawing tannins.A huge success given the price. Impeccably smooth on the bouquet, with clean yet generous berry aromas. Ripe and balanced, with bright berry and chocolaty oak flavors. Solid on the finish, with lasting plum and berry flavors. Satisfying in every way.Dry red fruit and tomato notes define the nose on this light-colored Pinot. Flavors of earthy cherry and spice get buried under buttery oak, which carries through onto the finish.Full but roasted and rubbery, with baked berry aromas leading to a thick, semistewed palate with dark berry and vanilla flavors. The palate is big but choppy, and the finish is also thick and tannic. Definitely round and meaty, but slips to the stewy side.Dark and full-bodied, with a big bouquet of coconut, char and blackberry. The palate is thick and chunky, and that seems right given the wine's sweet black-fruit and chocolate flavors. Add in some oak, baking spice and mocha and you've got a solid, tasty, generous wine.Sweet, grapey and candy in a glass, with blueberry aromas. Feels rubbery and jammy, with stewed berry and herbal flavors. If ganador is “winner” in Spanish, this doesn't quite qualify.Nice and pure, with controlled berry aromas, a dash of pepper and integrated background oak. A tasty, easy-to-drink wine with fine balance and fresh flavors of cherry, raspberry, cassis, chocolate and a medicinal finish. Good depth, length and size throughout. Delicious Malbec.Brambly and wild on the nose, this Cafayate Malbec features a narrow palate with edgy, briary plum and berry flavors. This seems riper with time in the glass, but all the way through it's pinchy in feel and ultimately ends with candied sweetness.Herbal and foresty up front, this Bordeaux blend smells of fig, caramel and berry fruits. Big, tannic and chunky on the palate, this has toasty, chocolaty, burnt flavors and a blackened finish. This offers a lot of power and fruit but it's brusk.For two years running this Torrontes is White Pearl's most praiseworthy wine. It is true and tasty, with flowery aromas leading to flavors of lychee, papaya, melon and grass.

Lightly toasty, with a mild cherry flavor to the finish.Citric smelling, with floral notes and dampness. The palate is more thin and grating than expected, with red fruit, citrus, cherry sucking candy and graham cracker flavors. Finishes a bit edgy and candied, and overall it's generic with little personality.Smells a lot like fresh celery and/or asparagus, with vibrant green fruit aromas and lettuce thrown in for good measure. Juicy in the mouth, with apple, citrus and green veggie flavors.

There's not much structure or body here, but it's juicy and just tasty enough due to good candied berry and plum flavors. A regular but steady everyday Cab.Black in color, with a severe, jammy nose that's ominous and heavy. The look and bouquet portend the flavors, which are thick, raisiny and pruney. This is over-the-top heavy and extracted, with an inky outlook and subpar balance.Exemplary and exotic in the same breath.

Refined, deep and pure on the palate, with blackberry, marzipan and licorice flavors. Very nice Argentine Cabernet for the money. Drink now into 2011.Cherry and plum aromas carry the mildest touch of stem, yet the palate is reasonably stocky. Cherry and chocolate flavors may seem slightly confected, but given the wine's price it's hard to register many complaints. A creamy and flavorful finish makes this well worth the money.Fleshy peach, melon and pineapple aromas on the nose. Feels lifted and fresh, and decidedly not oaky, with citrusy orange and nectarine flavors. Fruity, round and easy on the finish.This opens with a blast of blueberry, sweet grass and baking spices.

Tropical on the finish, but also slightly bitter. Solid by Mendoza standards but nothing special.Inky aromas of blueberry and boysenberry are a bit collapsed and reduced. Tannic and grabby in the mouth, this tastes of leathery plum and salt.

Oaky flavors of butterscotch and baked apple end with a note of caramel.Stemmy top aromas cover up earthy berry notes. This is grabby in the mouth with an acid-tannin package that sits on the hard side. Herbal red-berry flavors come with minty green notes and a stalky finish.

Flavors are pure, modestly oaky and deep in terms of wild berry, coffee and chocolate.Dark, crusty aromas mix with sweet coconut on the nose, while the palate seems lactic and oaky despite fairly pointed acidity. Berry and plum flavors are entirely regular, and the finish is sharp due to the aforementioned acidity. A bit leafy tasting as well.Hard and spiky on the nose, and not a whole lot better in the mouth. The flavors are tart and juicy, while the lean finish is ultratangy and sharp.Granular and syrupy on the nose, and that same thickness of fruit is resurrected on the palate. Gritty on the finish, and sweet and lifeless as a whole.Dense and leathery on the nose, this has aromas of briary berries and a hint of corn/masa. It feels round and textured, with healthy tannins and chewy flavors of blackberry, roasted beef and herb.

Sincere and excellent for the price.Grapey and foxy, with green, minty aromas and a hollow center. The palate is bulky, heavy and tannic, while the flavors are strained and grapey. Sweet and incomplete; grapey but not in harmony.This is Chardonnay with small amounts of Pinot Grigio and Viognier. The nose is nutty, oily and low on fruit.

Seems roasted and devoid of quality. Unclean and unimpressive.Plenty of patience is required with this wine, because at first it's rough and stewy, with herb and tomato aromas. Airing reveals a blackberry core and tannin-infused oak notes, while the finish features mostly char and vanilla. Has its merits but also some weaknesses.Floral and tropical aromas are a direct reflection of the 75% Torrontés in the blend. There's also lychee, another Torrontés byproduct. Otherwise, it's lean and tangy, with tangerine, lychee and green melon flavors. The more it opens the more it smells like a kitchen cleanser. But the forwardness and snap are admirable. Contains 15% Viognier and 10% Chardonnay.Tons of color, fruit and weight add up to a big, fun but clumsy hunk of generic red wine. With a slightly slick feel and not much structure, it's a wine that's meant to go down easy.Herbal black-fruit aromas come with a lot of oak. This is full, chunky and meaty in feel, with green hints and blackberry flavors appearing before a blast of hickory smoke takes over. A high-toast, slightly bitter finish confirms the strong oaky character.Among the new crop of Patagonian Malbecs, this wine shows a sly style. It's not that full of bells and whistles but it does offer plenty of ripe red fruit such as cassis, cherry and strawberry. Blended in are touches of tobacco and leather. Goes down smooth and easy; registers more lush and ripe than anything. Imported by S&F; Trading Company.Whether it's this single-vineyard Malbec or its partners below (Turcos or Tanos), the characteristics of each are nearly identical: creamy oak, tons of vanilla and milk chocolate, resiny mouthfeels and rich, sweet berry flavors. Pick one or pick them all; they are quasi interchangeable and only time will tell if they show individuality or remain identical triplets.Spicy and woody at first, with tons of black fruit. The nose shows a hint of dill, but for the most part the wine's pure and full of plum, blackberry, vanilla and good tannins. Firm and loaded, with cola on the finish. Yet another success in Trapiche's new line of old-vine, single-vineyard Malbecs. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.Aromas of pickled cabbage and cider are not too attractive, while the palate is surprisingly spritzy and tastes of sweet canned fruit, vanilla and oak dust.

The palate is round and a little soft and plump, with prune, fig and blackberry flavors. Sweet and easy throughout, with a mild finish. Nothing out of the ordinary.Creamy, bland and short on kick, aromas and flavors. The palate is spongey and tastes of creamed apple, light herbs and white pepper. It's inoffensive but not worth much attention. Finishes a bit vegetal as well.Noemía's signature Malbec, now in its third vintage, is one of the country's best. It starts out herbal and smoky, with a lot of dark French oak. The mouth is powerful and pure, with at least three layers of complex flavors and textures. The fruit is both subtle and loud. Simply an excellent wine of world-class character. Best in 2008–09.Light in color, with transparency, something you usually don't see with Malbec. The nose is rubbery, saucy and a touch grassy, while the palate is tannic and grabby, with stewy, rustic, roasted berry flavors. Finishes with the taste of barbecue sauce.Aromas of baked corn and citrus lead to a sharp, tangy palate that offers lemon and other citrus flavors, but not much heft or sweet fruit to balance things off. Thus it's a razor-sharp and edgy bubbly with lemony sourness all the way through the finish.This driving blend of Malbec with Syrah and Cabernet hails from Argentina's most northern vineyards.Bruising black plum and cassis aromas have mossy, floral sidenotes. It's grapy but not monotone, so you get boysenberry then spice flavors, especially clove.

The palate, meanwhile, runs a bit sweet, with boysenberry and plum. Soft on the back end, but with enough spine to see it through. For fans of bold reds.This reflects the big, modern style of Mendoza Malbec. The bouquet is ripe and hefty, with coconut, mint, blackberry and almond cookie aromas.

Drink through 2018.A rock-solid Malbec with attractive yet simple aromas of black cherry and raspberry. The palate is juicy and fresh, but with enough body to provide a sense of richnes.

This is jammy, dense, soft and not for aging, but it does deliver a truck load of toasted coffee, blackberry, molasses and crisped brown sugar. Supersweet, rich and made to drink now.This Tempranillo is leafy and leathery, with light raspberry aromas backed by thin plum and berry flavors. It's an aggressive, standard red wine that's neither here nor there.Frenchman Bernard Magrez is building a global brand via high-quality, smartly named wines such as this (La Bienvenida means The Welcoming in Spanish). But the cuteness ends there; this is serious Malbec with maple, leather and coffee aromas in addition to rich berry scents. The palate is integrated and deep, with lively acidity and tannins but enough cuddly fruit to ensure balance. An excellent Argentinean debut for Monsieur Magrez. Imported by Bernard Magrez USA.Aromas of white grapefruit, celery and other prickly fruits lose steam with airing, while the green apple and lime flavors are solid and offer some sweetness. Wet in the mouth, which is what you want, but standard fare as a whole.On one hand you'll find bacon, rubber and smoke aromas, but on the other there's stem and murky notes that bring it down. The palate has sharp acidity and flavors of roasted red berries and pepper. For a Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend, it seems lean, stemmy and wanting.Nicely aromatic, with all that's good about affordable Malbec from Argentina: bold fruit, depth and some richness. The palate is plump and stocked with tasty blackberry, plum and raisin flavors, while the finish is sturdy and subtle. A good wine that should not offend anyone.Black fruit and a hint of tire rubber work the nose, and that's backed up by raspberry and sweet vanilla flavors. This wine is pretty good overall, with depth and push, but it's also a bit starchy and slightly green at its core.Powerfully oaked but awkward, with bruising aromas of fresh-cut wood, sawdust and campfire smoke. Amid the woodiness and thick body you'll find roasted plum and berry flavors, but on the finish resin reappears and lingers. Tastes too saucy and resiny to be called “clean.”Unus is 70% Malbec and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, but what you need to know is that it's 100% excellent. The nose features a rich blend of tobacco, baked plum and leather, while the palate is saturated, concentrated and tastes of cassis and blackberry. Clean, intense and complexHere's another success from Bodega Norton. The nose is rich and big, with crusty chocolate and coconut aromas. More chocolate blends with blackberry and pepper in the mouth, while on the finish there's sexy layered darkness. It's New World pomp and pleasantness in all its glory.Hot and rubbery on the nose, and while it doesn't smell bad it doesn't persuade you to go further. The palate has size, but it's not smooth as the acids dominate. And the flavors of berry and cherry are generic and almost impossible to identify as Syrah. Forgettable wine with tartness.Smells candied and gummy, with sweet, stewy red-berry aromas along with carob. The palate is fairly full and tannic, with cooked, herbal berry flavors that carry over onto the finish, which folds in coffee and grabby tannins. Good enough but sort of stewed and candied.Citrus, acacia blossom and patchouli oil give this an interesting and true-to-Cafayate bouquet. The palate delivers a shot of lychee fruit along with   tangerine and melon, with lemon meringue pie to finish. One of Argentina's better Torrontes; drink now.Complete but not overly exciting. The nose has Malbec's basic black fruit and spice components, while the palate is a little high in acidity and sharpness, but also shows buttery oak and blackberry fruit. Fruity but oaky, with some excess tart acidity on the finish.Lightly baked and sweet on the nose, which draws you in. The palate is brighter and more austere, with sheer, slightly bland cherry and raspberry flavors. Fresh, clean and bouncy on the finish, but never does it turn the corner toward greater complexity or quality. Good to average overall.Generic at best, with lemon and pool water aromas that aren't about to stir many smiles. The palate is flat almost to the point of mushy, with dull lychee and green apple flavors.An opening of lightly baked black fruit aromas and graham cracker is pleasant and ready, while the palate has size, a cushioned feel and herbal, spicy berry flavors and a swatch of oak on the back end. With oak and toast on the finish, it comes to a nice conclusion. Good Malbec with some pedigree.One of Altocedro's better efforts starts with meaty, ripe, chunky black fruit aromas and a wave of mocha, cocoa and berry syrup. It's a creamy specimen but has enough acidity and vitality to not run flat. Mocha, carob and plum extend through the finish. Drink now.Dark aromas suggest shoe polish and roasted black fruits. This feels rubbery and chunky, while the flavor profile includes quick pokes of cherry, plum and rubbery berry before a salty-tasting finish.Light and red in style, with food-friendly acidity and good overall balance and presence. Has sheer qualities and crisp fruit flavors, but it's not sour or too edgy. Smells like Pinot and tastes like it, too.Not bad for basic Argentine Chardonnay. The nose has banana and tropical fruit aromas to go with dried hay, while the soft-bodied palate has enough acidity to keep it flowing. Flavors of melon, banana and vanilla are solid even though it flattens out and shows mild bitterness on the finish.Earthy and deep from head to tail. The nose offers fresh compost, loamy berry, cola and overriding richness. Feels smooth and layered across the palate, with dark berry, pepper and bitter chocolate flavors. Blackened on the finish and toasty; 50% Malbec with four additional Bordeaux varieties.A bit jumbled and certainly it goes heavy on the oak. But as things settle you'll find buttery vanilla notes accenting relatively solid berry fruit. The end result is pretty good. Give it some air.Here's a crisp by-the-glass style of Pinot that's bringing good cherry and raspberry aromas, mild spice notes, and then a firm but lean body with plenty of acidity to propel crisp, cutting flavors of red plum and tart berry. Light and sheering but not sour or too thin.There aren't many Argentine Sauvignon Blancs that make a statement, so this is commendable for showing a lightly citric and minerally nose in front of fresh, citrusy flavors of lime, tangerine and grapefruit. More friendly and easygoing than intense or pungent, it fades quick and easy on the finish.Fairly herbal, with burnt briar aromas that cause it to tilt toward acrid. The palate shows mostly tart cranberry and wild berry flavors, and while it looks dark to the eye, the wine is surprisingly shallow and a little bit sharp in the end run.Brilliantly colored, with dynamite concentration and lovely black fruit and earthy aromas. Precise on the palate but also big and muscular, with silky tannins, grip and a late rush of deftly applied French oak. Delicious and a fine reflection of the Uco Valley, Argentina's top Malbec region.Clean and tropical, and not too heavy, oily or chunky. The nose is pure lemon, pear and apple, while the flavor profile revolves around citrus, apple and honey in the center. Finishes sweeter than it starts, but with dry papaya for balance. Good everyday Chardonnay from Argentina, something we don't see too often.Smoky and rubbery smelling, with brambly, mildly stemmy fruit aromas. The palate is plummy and red in character, with herbal raspberry on the back side. Dry, tangy and herbal on the finish; adequate at best as a whole, even at $9.Roasted and rubbery on first take, with aromas of leather, beefy blackberry and a pinch of herbal juniper and sharpness. The palate is racy and flows well, with lightly herbal flavors of red plum, raspberry and leather. Long on the finish, with a juicy feel.Heavily coated with coconut and oiled leather aromas, however, the palate recedes to Bonarda's typical angularity. The flavors of blackberry and cherry are solid, but the mouthfeel runs rough and sheer. And it finishes with some saltiness and leather. A good wine, not without its fault.Full and inviting up front, with hickory and leather in addition to dark-fruit aromas. This is a collaboration between two Italian buddies and the wine features black cherry and plum flavors but also rather grabby, heavy tannins. It's ultimately chewy and a bit hard, but still it's eminently satisfying.Heavy hayfield aromas are oxidized, and the flavors of almond peel, citrus pith and baked banana do nothing to impress. Not a fresh or healthy wine, if it ever was. Past its prime.A heady wine with mocha, chocolate, balsamic notes and black fruit on the bouquet. At first it seems thick and dumbed down, but it opens up to display bold berry flavors, stewed fruit, chocolate and savory accents. It's just lively enough, but overall this ranks as a saturated, bulky, round wine that falls squarely into the category of New World and ripe.Aggressive lemon-lime aromas are itchy, and the nose turns grassy and green. Overactive in the mouth, and tough to hold on the palate. Just at the level of acceptable; warning signs have been posted.Earth and leather aromas give it some personality, while violet, plum and blackberry form the base of the bouquet. The mouth is a touch rough and drying, but it houses both red and black fruit flavors along with chocolate. Lighter in weight than its Mendoza competition, but that's Patagonia in a nutshell.Basic cherry and raspberry aromas have a candied tone to them, yet the palate is zesty and tart, with linear raspberry flavors that are crisp and finish like a red-fruit sucking candy. A lot of acidity and not much body. Decent but stretched thin.Fairly dense on the nose, with aromas of coffee grounds, leather and beef stew along with berry fruit. The palate is true, with plum and brambly berry flavors. However, the feel is a bit choppy due to sharp acidity. A good blend that will do well with food.Jammy red-fruit aromas mixed with buttery oak make for a simple, sappy nose. There's more butter on the palate in addition to solid blackberry flavors. It finishes round but short, with yet another wave of barrel. A very good wine but not one that wows.Powerful but reduced, with gritty berry aromas and a ton of clove on the nose. There's a carry over of the clove in the mouth, and also roasted fruit flavors, wood spice and sweetness. Powerful for sure, but arguably a bit too woody for its own good.Big and purple, with ripe aromas of black fruits and bacon. The mouth is filling and full, with oaky blackberry, coffee and mildly roasted flavors. Turns more lush and soft on the finish, which is long and tastes of fig paste and prunes. Gets it done for the most part.Dark in color and that's backed up by deep earthy aromas and black fruit. In the mouth it's full and sweet, with baked fruit, chocolate and coffee flavors. Finishes with rich berry and molasses notes, and for a candied, sweet-styled Cabernet it gets the job done.Sol Huarpe's top wine, Xumek, has style and saucy sass. It's not just cookie-cutter ripe and rich, but instead shows herbs, mushroom and also ample black plum and berry flavors. In general it's nice for those seeking a touch more from their Argentinean Malbec. And it hails from lesser-known San Juan and not Mendoza, which may explain its unusual characteristics.Starts out smoky and seemingly ripe, but the nose is the best part. The palate, by contrast, is tight, gritty and the flavors are awkward at best. Really not that consistent and loses focus the more you get into it. Imported by Freixenet USA.Light, clean aromas of melon and vanilla are pleasant and don't overpower. The palate is lucid and medium in weight, with green melon and ripe apple flavors. Lime and green apple carry the finish. Works well; drink immediately.Big, lush and tightly structured, with cola and mocha aromas along with serious black fruit power and brightness. A pure and delicious Malbec-Cabernet wine with the full allotment of berry character, cola accents, dark spice and clarity. Drink now through 2014.Jammy and saturated, with ripe plum, berry and tar aromas. It's fairly sweet and hedonistic in the mouth, but with enough pulsing acidity to keep things in balance. Smoky, racy and juicy on the back palate; this is one of the better Salentein wines we've tried lately.Overtly floral and jumpy, with potent aromas of perfume. Heavy in the mouth, with odd, bland flavors of applesauce and spice. Soft and sticky.Opens with hard, rubbery, leathery aromas. In the mouth, it's thick and chewy with black fruit but also an herbal edge. There's depth and plenty of oak here, and it finishes sweet and relatively smooth. Starts rough, improves in the middle, and then finishes fairly well.This overoaked Malbec smells almost entirely of clove and chocolate. It's bulky and creamy in feel, with bland, stewy berry flavors and a blanket of oaky clove. Oak spice and heat control the finish.This Malbec-Tempranillo blend is trying to be one of those new-wave super bruisers and it achieves that goal, but only to a point. It's big, round, savory and lush, but it's shallow in the midsection because it lacks acidity and punch. Beefy but incomplete. Imported by Winesellers Ltd.From longtime Catena winemakers Mariano de Paola and Pepe Galante, this is a deep, black-fruited Malbec with a cushioned bouquet, violet notes and delightful blackberry character. The palate is deep, juicy, healthy and balanced, and the finish is smooth and offers a whiff of coconut. Solid, serious and good now through 2013.Cherry and mild leather aromas are inviting, while the medium-bodied palate, despite having some bite and edge, is topped off with cassis, cherry and light medicinal flavors. A bright wine with lively acidity and touches of oak, butter and vanilla on the finish.Gaseous, oily and flowery on the bouquet, with lemon and apple notes. Feels round and adequately acidic, with stalky, burnt flavors of lemon and melon. Short and rough on the finish.Sort of gaseous and touchy on the nose, with bramble and sweaty leather rising up once the bouquet opens. The palate offers a quick flash of berry fruit but nothing backing that up, and the finish is gone in seconds. Basically this is a light-bodied quaffer that seeks not to offend.Rhubarb and tomato leaf are strongly present on the nose, followed by grassy flavors and a hollow, thin mouthfeel. Septima is Spanish-owned, and this 800-case bottling seems like a nod to the homeland. But it tastes anything but Spanish.Over the years the Fantelli wines have not impressed, but this Torrontes works nicely, especially if you like some weight and sweetness to your white wine. The nose offers apple blossoms and honey, while the peach, pear and applesauce flavors are round and sweet. Seems to have some residual sugar.Full, dark and smoky on the nose, then juicy, tight and well built on the palate. Tastes good, with fast-moving black fruit and chocolate flavors fading quickly into a clean, moderate finish. Lively and tight for Malbec.Chunky and on the verge of overripe, with soft peach and melon aromas. Additional peach and melon flavors define the overweight palate, while the finish is heavy but flavorful. Tasty stuff with merits, but its lifespan is going to be short. Imported by 57 Main Street Wine Co.A little damp and heavy, with molasses, stewed berry and char on the nose. The palate, however, is fairly jumpy and alert; fiery berry flavors hit with force and some heat. On the finish you'll find berry essence and some bramble. Is it slightly green at its core? We think so. Imported by Southern Wine Group.Earthy aromas suggest red cabbage and olive more than bright, ripe berry. The palate is chunky and clampy, with jammy, overly broad black fruit flavors that finish on the stewed and herbal side. Concentrated, massive and clumsy.A nice wine with aromas of lead pencil, violets, black fruit and a sprinkling of lemon zest. The palate has body and a chunky outlook, while the flavors of berry fruits, spice and something slightly exotic work. A solid, approachable wine that should bring a smile to the face of any Malbec lover.Firm and leathery smelling, with a drying, oaky nose and then lifted, sweet flavors of jammy raspberry and cassis. The fruit here is riper than many '08 Cabs, and while it's a bit lean in feel, it tastes good and offers ample spice for balance.Fruity, pure and smooth on the nose, and maybe more dry and leathery than the blasting Nicasia vineyard wine. The palate has a deep, classy elegance along with power, and the flavors run toward huge black fruits, coffee and chocolate. Finishes dark, long and minerally, and overall it's yet another awesome top-flight Malbec from this world-class winery. Drink now through 2014.Chakana makes some good wines, and the pack is led by this prestige-level blend of Cab Sauvignon, Malbec and Bonarda. It's plenty racy and forward, with plum and berry flavors that ring the bell. Toward the end some oak-based vanilla enters the game to applause. A yummy, well-made wine.Nice color and plenty of fruit on the nose add up to a welcome mat. The palate deals berry fruit galore, especially raspberry, cassis and black cherry. Juicy but still a little plump on the finish, with overall balance equal to that of a dancer. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.Smoky and sultry smelling, with berry jam aromas and ample subtleties. The palate is tannic and lively, like a good, masculine youngster should be. And the flavors of raspberry and plum are vivid and smack hard against the inside of your cheeks. Could use a year, but it's drinkable now with steak.A direct blast of reedy cherry and cassis aromas leads to rough-charging clampy palate with high acidity and hard tannins. This tastes of rooty plum supported by bold acidity, while spice, tomato and a dusting of brown sugar are the closing flavors.Quite piercing on the nose, with unyielding cherry and hard-spice aromas. The palate is also intense, with saturated black cherry and raspberry flavors riding rough on a tight frame. Not the most friendly and easy Malbec.Nice enough but not all that varietal in terms of aromas, flavors or anything. There's big red and black fruit aromas and flavors along with firm tannins, extract and some pepper. It's rich and chewy, but also tannic and fairly regular. For the price it should not disappoint.Less volatile than Layla's other red wines but still a stretch. Stewed cherry and plum flavors work the flat palate, while the finish is more soupy than it should be. Good compared to its siblings, but pretty weak in the grand scheme of things.Black as night, with aromas of leather, wild berries and wet dog. It is salty and oaky in the mouth, with vanilla and tannin but not a whole lot of ripe, lovable dark fruit. Gets better as it evolves, but where's the dark, sweet fruit to match the oak, tannins and tightness?Bold and pruney, with herbal, soft, ultraripe aromas in front of a jumpy yet partially stewed palate. This blend of Malbec with Bonarda and Syrah is your typical huge, tannic bruiser with big extract, huge tannins and just enough acidity to keep it pumping. Pretty good and perfectly drinkable, but a little over the edge.Raw and lacking in concentration, this wine delivers pedestrian fruit with a lactic, buttery consistency.

Finishes a little pithy and mealy, with a final wave of muskiness.The wine is called 40 Barrels and every bit of those barrels is crawling on this Malbec-Cab blend. For starters, it smells more like hickory than fruit. Soon blackberry and prune aromas and flavors get into the game, but even then the back palate and finish are resiny.

Firm acidity guarantees this will last at least another five years before falling off.An exotic style of Malbec with Middle Eastern spice, violet, anise and berry aromas. The palate has hammering tannins but enough body to absorb it, leaving herbal black fruit, fig and peppery flavors. Warm and toasty on the finish, with savory notes that last for a good long while.Light up front, with slight floral and banana aromas.

The palate runs sweet but maintains its freshness, and the flavors of apple, pear, melon and powdered sugar come together.

Combine that with huge tannins and extract, and what should be pleasant and fruity becomes a stampede across the palate.Grassy, herbal aromas rest on top of basic red-fruit notes. This feels choppy and hollow, with flavors of buttery oak, chemical and red currant. The raw hot finish doesn't have a lot of body or padding.Supposedly Doña Paula's top selection for 2005, and while the wine shows some earthy darkness and plenty of fruit on the bouquet it doesn't follow up with the mouthfeel or overall balance that it should.

This is better than your average Argentinean Chardonnay, especially if you like some tropical warmth and weight. Drink right away to catch its vitality.Tropical fruit aromas are suggestive of bath soap and body oil. This feels obtuse, with depth and an oily sensation to the palate. Chunky, ripe, oily flavors of melon and orange finish loud and ripe, with a deeper set of tropical fruit flavors than your average Argentine Torrontés.Once you cut through the heavy, minty oak, there's a decent wine hiding in the folds.

Tastes pulsing and ripe, with big red fruit flavors, candied sweetness, coconut and chocolate.Clean but weightless, with little substance or stuffing to it. This is a cool-climate, Patagonian Chard from young vines, hence it is reticent and watery. The winery's pricier Patagonian Select is a better option.Aromas of beets and dry spice drive the harsh nose. The palate is hard and defined by bitter pepper and cherry flavors.

Expansive and buttery smooth on the finish, this should be opened now–2016.Almost floral, but with aromas of crushed minerals and tar.

The Cab and Merlot work together seamlessly, as the nose exudes raspberry and sweet leather. Tastes warm and toasty, with ripe fruit softened by chocolate and pillowy tannins. Argentine red at its affordable best.Forward and lively but challenged and pithy. The apricot and melon flavors are bolstered by acidity, but the wine tastes more citric and snappy than suave. And the finish also doesn't offer much beyond citrus. Definitely not lifeless but where's the Chardonnay character?Intense, saturated and well balanced, with touches of motor oil, earth and herbs on the nose.

A spicy, herbal, chocolaty finish is punchy and borderline punishing.It's been many years since we've reviewed a Q Cabernet from Zuccardi, and this one is typically oaky, with plum, raisin, rubber, pepper and roasted fruit on the nose. The palate is tannic and firm, with meaty, grabby berry flavors offset by mocha, vanilla, caramel and other wood-driven flavors. Good wine but it comes with some bite and burn.Soft, lightly fragrant and peachy, with a hint of talcum powder to the nose. The palate offers your basic mix of melon and lychee, while the feel is good and there's a persistent finish. Straightforward stuff.Graffigna has shown improvement with its current set of releases. This Cab starts out dark, charred and full of blackberry aromas and flavors. It initially seems flashy and ready for anything. But the more you run it across your palate, the more the acidity rises up. And before long it almost seems scouring and jumpy. Imported by Pernod Ricard, USA.Dilute and gritty, with cleanliness issues. The palate is thin, scratchy and tastes like brambly berry fruit mixed with clay. And it finishes with tomato notes and a dull scour.A joint venture between the Renacer winery of Argentina and Chile and Allegrini from the Veneto in Italy. Thus it makes sense that this five-grape blend is done in the Amarone style, with concentrated, dried grapes. Aromas are generous, minty and floral, and the palate is jammy and concentrated. Rich and a little raisiny, just like Amarone. Drink now.This global brand has a hit in Mendoza. The '06 Malbec is lively and made right, with hickory and charred steak aromas mixing nicely with the blueberry and blackberry character in the wine. It's a darn good New World red for not much cash, and it should hold up well for at least a couple of years.Slightly stalky on the nose, with aromas of haystack and snappy citrus fruits. The palate is citrusy and acidic, with flavors of orange and grapefruit. Rounds into form with airing and time in the glass, but overall it's just a modest, regular SB for basic purposes.This vintage seems more medicinal and overtly ripe than the more balanced 2003. It has high alcohol (15.2%) and medium acidity, thus it's a touch gummy and syrupy. But if you like power at the core of your Cabernet-Merlot blends and you don't mind a little fire in the hole after drinking, then we recommend this chewy, ripe, very modern offering.Crusty on the nose, with aromas of leather, saucy fruit and alcohol. The wine is full and sweet, with ripe, sturdy flavors of blackberry, plum and raisin followed by fudge and herbs.

Fresh feeling due to high acidity but otherwise dull in taste and short on substance, flavor and concentration.Sharp, spiky and raw to start, with sassy fruit and aromas of smoked meat and polished leather. In the mouth, more identifiable flavors of plum, raspberry and beet take over, and time allows for it to unfold. Finishes sturdy, with perfect tannins and perky acids.

How nice to see an individual wine like this.Heavy oak greets you on the nose in the form of shoe polish and blackened aromas. This feels ripe, solid and woody, with good structure.

The palate is healthy but not heavy, while the flavors of red berries and currants are tasty but anonymous to the point that it's hard to identify the wine as Cabernet Sauvignon. Still, it's smooth, fruity and easy to drink.This you just have to love, especially for the price. Starts with graham cracker, kirsch and black cherry aromas before transitioning to chocolate, vanilla and coffee. Shows subtle touches but a lot of Argentinean power and pizzazz. Restrained but ripe; robust yet suave.A foxy berry aroma and a jammy character define the nose on this jumpy, juicy Bonarda.

A tannic, tough mouthfeel and cool-green flavors of minty blackberry finish with hot notes of toast and menthol.Sweet plum, raisin and chocolate work the welcoming nose, and on the palate the wine is generous but easy to understand; the flavors are flush and ripe but none too complicated. Simply stated, this wine is healthy and well made.This blend from the Nicasia and Adrianna vineyards is the best Malbec on the market today. There's raisin, mineral, licorice, blackberry and more.

Drink soon.Offers tropical, stony aromas in front of a crystalline palate that's citrusy as well as peachy, with lychee and melon flavors as well.

The palate is competent, with lemon-lime, apple and spiced Asian pear flavors. Dries out nicely on the finish; good Torrontés to drink as soon as possible.LTU is a small-production label that reaches big. The 2010 Malbec is rich and smooth up front, with robust, lusty aromas of coconut, graphite, blackberry and blueberry. Creamy oak and fresh acidity make for a plush, modern mouthfeel, while flavors of coconut, toffee, vanilla and blackberry are deep and pure. A ripe, round, decadent finish with flavors of toasted coconut flake, berry extract and tight tannins wraps this up. Drink through 2020.A difficult wine to assess. For starters, it's heavily oaked and very dark in aromas; think tar, char and espresso. The palate is narrowly focused and tannic, with dark fruit peeking thru here and there. Finishes sheer, with coffee and bitter chocolate. Could get better with time, or it might never really open up. Needs at least another year in bottle to show its true colors.Most of Bousquet's wines are enigmatic. They show some good qualities but also signs of overcropping and underripeness. That said, this wine is typical: it's scattershot in its delivery of green-infused berry fruit, tannins and wood. It's O.K. but never settles down. Imported by North American Beverage Group.Simple earth, rubber and berry aromas come prior to cranberry, plum and cherry flavors. Finishes quickly, with drying tannins. A tight, limited wine that won't offend or excite.Forward and lively but challenged and pithy. The apricot and melon flavors are bolstered by acidity, but the wine tastes more citric and snappy than suave. And the finish also doesn't offer much beyond citrus. Definitely not lifeless but where's the Chardonnay character?A touch stemmy on the nose, but in the mouth it comes around. The flavors are in the plump, pithy zone (think orange rind and grapefruit peel), while the finish is zesty but also pithy. Registers as your typical full-styled Malbec rosé that is o.k. on its best day.Brambly and wild on the nose, this Cafayate Malbec features a narrow palate with edgy, briary plum and berry flavors. This seems riper with time in the glass, but all the way through it's pinchy in feel and ultimately ends with candied sweetness.Sharp, pickled and sour smelling at first, although it does improve with airing. The palate has a good feel and proper size and roundness, yet the berry flavors are ultraherbal. Some oak and spice is detected on the finish. Unappealing on the nose; better on the palate.Woody and smelling of sawdust early, this four-grape blend eases toward roasted berry, cassis, herbal plum and molten chocolate. It's massive and structured, with a big-boned skeleton and heat on the leathery, roasted finish due to 15.5% alcohol. Big, fiery, saucy and lusty, but short on refinement and elegance.This is a blend of Cab Sauvignon, Malbec and Merlot that's agile, fresh and offers good mouthfeel. The nose deals crushed brick, leather, spice and light red fruit, while the flavors run toward red cherry and red currants. Uncomplicated; drink now. Imported by Quintessential Wines, LLC.Nondescript in terms of fruit flavors, with a strong hint of green pepper. Decent feel and length, with spice. But just too much green character to score better.Not sure why a Mendoza Malbec is named Havana Rose, but that's not really important when you taste this ripe, candied wine that shows reasonable balance and character. The palate offers bright, candied raspberry and sweet plum flavors, and the finish is warm and full. About all you can ask for in a $9 wine.Strained on the nose, with dirty fruit aromas, gaseousness and candy. The palate is cloying and confected, with muddy, jammy, herbal fruit flavors and a cooked, weedy finish.

Saucy and herbal as well.At 90% Tempranillo, this is not your average Argentine red. The nose is lean and hot, with spice that grows on you.

Drink now through 2012.Stalky aromas make for a sketchy opening. In the mouth, this is blocky and grabby in feel. Burnt, underripe flavors of berry fruits are herbal and finish with grassy notes.Minty and heavily oaked, with creamy aromas of vanilla bean, milk chocolate and raisiny sweetness. The palate smacks down with a tight, rubbery feel and then unleashes heavy, toasty flavors of herbal berry fruit, raw oak and mocha. Good for a rich, robust wine but it doesn't excel and it seems a little out of balance.More syrupy and chunky than ideal, but still a good wine with grilled meat, root beer and berry extract on the bouquet. The body seems a little baked and heavy, with molasses and raisin flavors mixing with blackberry. Finishes with melted brown sugar and soft tannins. A full, deep wine that shows a few signs of being overripe.Deep and juicy Malbec with aromas of violets, blackberry, coconut shavings and mineral.

With leather and brick dust accenting black-fruit aromas, the bouquet is positive. And the flavors of plum, blackberry, soy sauce and cola are very nice.

The palate is firm but not overly hard, with fig, black plum and length to the finish. Drink now through 2012.Weird, green, spicy and odd smelling, with hard, green raisiny flavors and an herbal finish. Barely acceptable; not varietally sound or interesting.This smells rubbery and horsey at first, then earthy and ripe. It feels grabby and tannic, with rustic, leathery flavors of baked berry and cheese. Narrow and a bit dried out, this may already be past its prime in terms of vitality.A bit heavy and granular on the nose, with oily aromas that raise question marks.

An aggressive, hard wine with sappy, jammy flavors; it delivers full kick and size.The price on this perennial bargain brand from Valentin Bianchi has crept up in recent years, and thus its value potential has stalled somewhat. But it's still a fruity number that once it opens and settles delivers jammy aromas and solid red-berry flavors. We like that it's neither candied nor weedy. 60,000 cases proves that good wine can be made in quantity.Allow some of the muscled-up aromas of rubber and churned earth to blow off and what's left are true blackberry aromas and seductive plum, berry, coffee and cola flavors.

Chunky and close to being oversaturated, this full-bodied red tastes of loamy berry and raisin, while the finish is weighty.Apple cider and caramel on the nose, and that aromatic combo doesn't stir much interest. Tastes like mulled cider, while the finish is thick with caramel and toffee. A heavy, oily Chardonnay that could use better balance and flavors.Mute on the nose, with only rubber cement and anonymous dark fruit showing up. Tastes of ripe plum, carob and burnt toast, while the finish offers vanilla shadings then a blast of heat. Not a smooth operator.Dry and lightly balsamic on the nose, with solid fruit aromas that show a marginal level of stem. The palate is stacked with black cherry and blueberry along with full tannins. The finish, however, is surprisingly silky, with chocolate and coconut flavors. A deep, nice, layered wine that has a lot going for it.Hard and capped on the bouquet, with plastic aromas, dry oak, milk chocolate and mint. Feels resiny and cloying, with wood-led flavors and resin. Tastes bland and overoaked for what it is.Stalky, waxy aromas get this subpar varietal white going in the wrong direction. In the mouth, it's mushy, with creamy, briny, almost bitter flavors.Heady plum and dark berry aromas give a warning of size and ripeness, and indeed there's a ton of ripe fruit to the palate; but the wine is also raw, untamed and lacking in mouthfeel. It could stand to flow and finish better than it does.As far as Argentine Syrah goes, this vintage of Iscay, which contains 3% Viognier in a nod to France, is the new benchmark for the country. Daniel Pi and Joey Tensley's wine discloses aromas of jammy berry fruits along with cardamom and floral notes.

Drink through 2018.Chunky, broad and slightly rubbery smelling, with baked aromas, leather and other more serious scents. The palate is full-bodied and warm, but not all that complex. Flavors of baked plums, cassis and licorice are nice, and the finish brings chocolate brownie into the game. For immediate drinking.Roasted, oaky and resiny on the nose, and then the palate delivers a bolt of acidity that makes the wine feel pointy in the mouth. The flavors are herbal and resiny, with foresty black fruit at the core. Creamy and sticky on the finish, and overall it struggles to present a pure, balanced picture.Intriguingly herbal, with spice, leather and oregano aromas as opposed to Malbec's more common jammy blueberry and blackberry characteristics. The palate is moderately juicy, with hints of pepper, baking spices and earth. Different than the pack, which is admirable.Ample red plum and cassis both on the nose and palate makes this a proper Malbec wine. However, it's juicy and a bit acidic on the tongue, which makes the plum core a little shrill. Overall it's lively, mildly herbal, honest and gets the job done. Definitely falls into the fresh and snappy category.Hard, crusty aromas loosen a little with time, but then you get pool water and foxiness. The palate is rough and lean in fruit content, with lactic, caroby notes accenting herbal red-fruit flavors.

The finish is chewy in feel, with a slightly herbal character.Aromas of lychee fruit, pineapple, nectarine and baby powder are fairly typical and welcoming. The palate offers bright but somewhat nondescript flavors that ultimately tilt toward melon. The finish hangs in there, showing moderate grace and length. All in all this is decent Torrontes from La Rioja, a province to the north of Mendoza.Rubbery and sort of reduced on the nose, with sulfur and gaseous notes. After airing, it shows a juicy but plump mouthfeel with standard, perfectly good blackberry and herbal flavors.

Hailing from Patagonia, this is a basic, creamy Cabernet with body and size but not too much character.Shows barely any color and then a hard, vapid, no-fruit bouquet. The mouthfeel is citric and the tastes range from lemon to lemon. Pithy, tart and frankly it's a barely drinkable rendition of Argentina's signature white grape.Murky smelling, with nondescript berry aromas. Ultratannic and hard in the mouth, much like chewing nails. Meanwhile, the flavors run herbal and earthy, with dark fruit carrying things to a hard, tannic finish.Rubbery, tarry and quite black in nature, with a full-bodied mouthfeel and meaty, spicy dark-berry flavors. This ranks as a voluminous wine with a heavy disposition; it's sweet and spicy late, with generic bold-fruit character throughout.Dry aromas of leafy, spicy red-berry fruits register as complex and mature. Medium in body, it has integrated tannins and acids. Flavors of lightly baked cherry and sweet red currant are earthy and finish with notes of cocoa powder, raspberry and plum. Drink now.Floral, sweet and powdery smelling, but pleasant. The palate is light and airy, with hardly any punch or kick. But that serves it well, and amid the sheets there's lime, green-apple notes and tropical shadings. Not bad for the price.Chakana has put out many good wines in recent vintages but this rough and tumble blend of Malbec, Bonarda and Syrah  comes across minty and forced on the nose and then grating on the palate. Yes, it's got color and power. But it lacks the balance and body that you'd expect. Frankly, it seems acidified.Flat and basic, with charred secondary aromas. Simple red fruit with rubbery tannins make for an average palate. Easy enough but hard to find anything special or exciting to go on about.

Notes of onion and grape skins rise up on the finish.

The palate has a good, healthy feel and flavors of roasted berry, pepper and cola. Finishes mildly minty yet juicy.Dark purple in color, but more leafy and murky than you'd expect on the nose. The palate has texture and weight, but it's also kind of dull feeling, which matches the wine's chunky, dull flavors. Decent enough, but still too herbal and challenged.Broquel is Trapiche's higher-end label, and generally speaking this Chardonnay is one of the best Argentineans going. Yes, there's a heavy dose of wood, but with time it meshes nicely into the apple, melon and citrus fruit that's prominently on display. Pure on the finish, with forward acidity. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.Tight, concentrated and deep, with rubbery aromas of black fruit and earth.

There's raspberry, tobacco and lemon peel on the nose, while the palate tastes of blackberry and tobacco, with some sweetness. Not pushy, a little strange, and overall very good.Getting pricey as Argentine Chard goes, this moderately rich wine has true aromas and flavors, meaning there's some apple, pear and butter to sniff and vanilla-tinged peach and melon to taste. Not as complex or complicated as maybe it should be, but easy to like.This blend of Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon is very woody, so much so that the nose offers mostly cinnamon and green lumber.

A spicy saucy-tasting finish holds onto the wine's minty green herbal essence.Jammy on the nose, with a citrusy element, green notes and something muddy. For a big Malbec with a full price tag, it leaves me wondering: It's chunky and tastes of red berry, citrus, pineapple and marshmallow. Jumbled and sweet on the finish. Has enough good in it not to tank but it's not in full harmony.Catena's signature wine is Cabernet Sauvignon-based, and it's a purple haze of dense, exotic aromas that lean toward lavender, flower petals and black fruit. It's saturated and fruity to the point of no return, with impeccable structure and mouthfeel. An avalanche of flavor and style. Drink now through 2015.Varietally correct aromas of white flowers, lychee and tropical fruits feed into a plump, creamy palate that's losing some of the steam it probably had when it was bottled. Melon, banana and lychee flavors finish on the heavy, creamy side. Drink immediately.Warm and complete, with oak-influenced char and licorice along with black fruits on the bouquet. An elegant Uco Valley specimen with refined, full-force flavors of cola, blackberry, tobacco and chocolate. Turns more complex and satisfying on the finish. Drink this high-quality value now through 2013. A blend of Malbec at 50%, with Cabernet, Petit Verdot and Syrah.Stemmy and fiery on the nose, with light raspberry aromas.

In the mouth, this Cabernet feels chunky, ripe and fully tannic. Savory berry fruit flavors and notes of cured meats and jerky finish a bit flat, with a lasting flavor of oaky chocolate. Drink through 2022.Murky and leathery on first take, with dry, earthy red fruit aromas emerging later on. The palate is fresh enough, with snappy acidity and tannic bite along with wan, mild fruit flavors and spice. Perfectly adequate but short on stuffing and depth.Mildly grassy and dilute on the nose, with sweet, candied berry flavors and a sticky, woody finish. It's fairly full in the mouth, but it lacks the precision, darkness and focus of a top-flight Malbec.Aromas of applesauce, lemon cake and lychee are probably the best part of the wine. In the mouth, it's chunky and wan, with candied, sweet apple and melon flavors.

It's healthy and even juicy on the palate, with blackberry, dark plum and tobacco flavors. An interesting wine that grabs and holds your attention. Drink now through 2012.Ordinary plum and berry aromas to start, followed by a more jammy palate that tastes of berry compote. A touch of chocolate and pepper carry the finish. All totaled this is decent wine with middle-of-the-road characteristics.Extreme ripeness is the first thing that strikes on the nose; then there's raisin, spiced fig and minerally richness that's far from everyday. The palate is huge and fills all corners of your mouth, while flavors of raisin, brown sugar, mocha and coffee come to an almost nonending finish that's the definition of dark and brooding. Drink through 2020.Dark fruit and leather on the nose seem fine, yet the palate is high-toned and starchy, with sharp flavors of cherry, plum and mushroom doing battle with severe tannins. And it's a touch saucy and salty on the finish. Imported by Victoire Imports.This is probably the best of the new line of Festivo wines from Monteviejo. The nose has a clean, fresh neutrality that serves it well, while the palate is bright and offers apricot and nectarine flavors. Turns more pithy on the finish, which is why we suggest that you drink it ASAP. Questionable value at $18.Closed and heavy on the nose, with baked-apple flavors and caramel. Weighs in as full-bodied, with toffee and bitter pith notes on the finish. Aims fairly high and delivers up to an extent: there's size and substance but also some overripeness, corn and pith. Not perfect, but not bad. Imported by Billington Imports.Take note, this could be the best wine Colomé has ever bottled. Cedary oak aromas grace ripe, almost desiccated wild berry notes that are slightly herbal and sauvage. A well-layered mouthfeel is ideal in power and precision.

Imported by Excelsior Wine & Spirits.Bright boysenberry aromas offer a touch of sugar beet and perfume, while the palate is all about jammy berry flavors with dark, lush shadings. Firm on the finish, with no holes to speak of. Undeniably ripe, with a good feel and plenty of richness. Imported by The Global Vineyard.Aromatic, with blueberry and dried jerky scents. Good fruit with earthy, chocolaty nuances creates a pretty palate that follows the nose nicely. On the downside, it turns thin toward the end. But it manages to stay juicy; in some ways it tastes like Zinfandel.Aromas of mocha, rubber, smoky leather and berry fruit indicate good things to come, but in the mouth this wine fails to deliver equal to its price and the previous successes of Trapiche's single-vineyard Malbec project. Scouring acidity is the main culprit; the wine seems clipped, tartaric and angular, thus it's all superficial and not deep or rich enough to rate better.Low-intensity apple and pear aromas lead to a tight high-acid mouth. Severe flavors of lemon and lime are fairly sour. A long direct finish is linear and shearing.Piercing aromas of char and creosote are like a laser pop surrounded by a note of blackberry.

The palate is juicy but also sort of rich, and the flavors of mixed red fruits feature a couple of layers of potency that are followed by a compact, medium-length finish.If the color doesn't tell the full story, the nose will: it's impeccably perfumed, round and sweet, with amazing fruit aromas and a toasty background. The feel is as lush and rich as they come, and there's outstanding purity to the lusty black fruit flavors. A masher with elegance. Maybe the best Malbec Argentina has ever produced. Drink from 2011–15.Hot and earthy up front, with mocha-like aromas. The palate and finish are syrupy, and the wine ends in a pool of chocolate and berry extract. This is an example of why Argentine Syrah has not found its groove.Aromas of apple cider are a touch acrid, while the palate is wet and easy but low in acidity. Flavors of melon and white fruits show some bitterness and break up in front of a flat finish.Smells murky, leafy and of compost. The palate is lean, dry and slightly rough, with green herb, tomato and light raspberry and strawberry flavors. Finishes herbal and tea-like, with more earthiness than clarity.Clos de los Siete, the amalgmated product of Michel Rolland's Uco Valley wine commune, is rich, round and ripe, with deep aromas and trimmings like polished oak and minerality. The wine is proper, medium to full in size, and full of blackberry, plum and cocoa. No hiccups, pure fruit and complexity make this stellar for the price.Buttercup and lemon aromas may not be overpowering but they are true to the variety. The flavors of melon and preserved tropical fruits work on the wine's fuller-bodied, almost creamy frame. Finishes warm but peachy, with an oily texture. Drink right away.The nose kicks off with ripe apple and zest and draws you in. The palate is live-wire pineapple and green apple with plenty of tang and a worthy mouthfeel. Even on the finish it holds the line.This is prickly and spicy on first take, followed by an aromatic wave of ripe berry and tobacco. It feels jammy and almost heavy, with creamy, milkshake flavors of blackberry, vanilla and cream, and a warm, Port-like finish. A blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot and 20%; drink now–2014.Starts out murky and sweaty, before showing cola, green herbs and leather. It's a rather jumpy, scattershot wine with plum and boysenberry flavors and a grapy, flush finish. The feeling here is that Terrazas wines were more consistent and elevated a few years ago.Slightly carbonic and gassy at first, with huge candied fruit aromas. But quickly the wine settles, and out comes sweet blackberry flavors and some gumminess. It's a chunky, easy wine with medium tannins and modest plushness, which is something you shouldn't necessarily expect from a value-positioned wine. Short on the finish, but plump and buttery.Strange smelling, with aromas of exotic spices, blueberry and some other notes that don't come across that well. Feels solid and chunky, with herbal, sweet flavors that culminate in a dry, rubbery, herbal-tasting finish.By far the best wine in the El Fogón lineup is this Torrontes. The nose is clean and harmonious, with light flower blossom scents. A citrusy mix blends with both apple and pear fruit on the palate, and the finish is clean, if a bit sweet (residual sugar?). Drink as soon as possible.Jammy and raisiny on the nose, but it also has fresh black-fruit and mocha notes that prevent the nose from seeming soft. This feels concentrated and jammy, with maple, mocha, blackberry and oak-influenced flavors. The rich, oak-driven finish shows even more notes of mocha, coffee and chocolate. Candy in a glass, but with structure.Lightly candied at first, but airing unveils more pure plum and raspberry aromas. Cherry, raspberry and plum flavors are standard but good, while the mouthfeel is firm and smooth enough. Mainstream all the way but likable.Opens with apple and buttercup aromas that are encouraging, but the palate falls off. It's wet but shows no definition or fruit. Creamy and generic in the mouth, and ultimately it doesn't go anywhere besides being plump and loaded with vanilla.Bright purple in color, a sure indicator that what's to come will be jammy and rich. The nose is all boysenberry and wood, with a hint of mineral. The palate is ultraripe but a bit clumsy and oversized. Not complex but very nice in a fruit-forward, knife-and-fork manner.Warm and earthy, with a touch of sulfur that subsides with air. The palate is juicy but also sort of rich, and the flavors of mixed red fruits feature a couple of layers of potency that are followed by a compact, medium-length finish.A touch cooked and oaky, but with a sweet, friendly side, too. The palate rests on beefy fruit, and it's chewable and just slightly herbal in nature. Finishes leathery and tannic, with chocolate and coffee notes. Imported by Pernod Ricard, USA.Deep, lush aromas of black fruits, graphite and coconut are welcoming and friendly. The mouthfeel is pure and smooth, with elegance and power. Flavors of cassis, blackberry, hard spices and licorice filter into a long, mellow, classy finish. This is a pushy, full-bodied wine that doesn't throw punches; drink through 2020.Full and overly chunky, but ultimately off-kilter. Too sweet and gummy.A hot and fiery wine from San Juan province that mixes stewy barnyard aromas with black cherry. The palate has a syrupy, sugary feel and medicinal, creamy, baked berry flavors. Peppery on the finish, but with a medicinal aftertaste.From La Rioja, this Torrontés is quiet and neutral. It offers a little tangerine on the nose, and then acceptable but unexciting banana and pear flavors. Overall it's decent but bland.Raisiny aromas lack freshness and lift. Following that lead, this Cabernet feels stewy and heavy, with questionable balance. Herbal flavors of stewed plum and tomato finish chunky and choppy.A wine that's seriously muscled up with tannin and oak. That's what you get with this rugged Argentinean Cabernet that comes with leafy notes of tobacco and mint along with raspy, grippy berry fruit. Maybe another year in bottle will help; now it's not that pleasant.Light, semisweet aromas of cherry show a modest level of concentration, while the palate is a bit rubbery and delivers good but regular cola and cassis flavors. There's a wave of milk chocolate to the fairly smooth but basic finish, and overall it's fine but doesn't get you excited. Only 250 cases made.\"",

            "\u001b[1;31mTypeError\u001b[0m: Could not convert Opens with sweet berry aromas that are inviting yet generic. The palate has plenty of acidity, making this Merlot food-friendly but racy on its own. Flavors of black cherry and dark plums are juicy, and there's a touch of spice and chocolate late.Vanilla and floral aromas have a suspicious artificiality to them, and in the mouth it's a sweet, sugary ride toward a cloying finish.Muddy plum and berry aromas lead to a sharp, rugged palate. Tart plum and pie cherry flavors end raw, rough and bitter.Aromas of rose hips, tomato leaf, raisin and black cherry get this fuller-bodied Pinot going on its way to a chunky palate of ripe raspberry, plum and creamy oak. There's length and a smooth mouthfeel, and it avoids common New World pot holes like faux butter or popcorn-like flavors. Drink now.Composed up front, with floral aromas matching wits with dry herb notes and solid berry fruit scents. The palate is snappy and crisp, with focus and narrow, tight flavors of raspberry and plum blended with vanilla. Bright and juicy throughout, with vanilla and toast on the finish.Fresh, inviting raspberry, strawberry and tempered vanilla aromas set up a snappy, equally fresh palate of cherry and raspberry. There's no excess heft, beef, extract or color to this wine; it's restrained but not miserly. And it finishes crisp and flashy. Well made and likely good with food.Sweet and candied on the nose, with marshmallow, cotton candy, chocolate-dipped cherry and dustiness. The palate has a pure feel and good ripeness, with flavors of herbal berry, toast, coffee and spice. Warm, chocolaty and oaky, with a lasting mocha flavor.Dark as night, with a rich, round, deep nose. Overt on the palate, with cherry, blackberry and plum. Juicy enough, with chewy tannins and firm acidity. Beefy enough to match with any meat and dark enough to substitute for paint. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.Layered aromas of cassis, berry, coffee and mocha come with regional Cafayate green notes. The palate is lively and offers ribald acidity along with red plum, berry, vanilla, spice and toast flavors. Turns more oaky the longer it's open, with vanilla and dill on the finish.Monteviejo, one of the Clos de los Siete wineries, has entered the unofficial “fun Malbec” category with Festivo, which has a stemmy, slightly burnt character that is present from start to finish. Along the way there are leathery black fruit flavors, herbal qualities and a good mouthfeel. Decent wine but decidedly herbal and stemmy.From a 50+-year-old vineyard in La Consulta in the Uco Valley comes this bold, seriously built Malbec. Black cherry and coconut aromas settle in nicely, followed by forward raspberry, mocha and coffee notes. Great acidity, tannic foundation, structure and fillings; it's like a happy house. Drink from 2011 through 2015.Aromas of medicinal cassis and plum show mild latex accents, but the wine is concentrated and solid on the palate, with cola, cassis and black fruit flavors. Medium bodied and fairly long on the palate, with cough drop, cassis and a pretty good feel to the finish. Equal parts Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon.Simple berry aromas are generic. This is dark on the palate, with black-fruit flavors that are standard and don't show much character. A lightly toasted finish is solid and not too choppy.Malbec and Bonarda are the lead grapes in this four-variety blend that shows improvement from the 2004, which was tough. Loads of ripe, dark fruit lead the way, with chewy, dense berry flavors coming next. It's bolstered by warm, oaky hints that settle on mocha and spice, so it fits the familiar style of what is good Mendoza wine.Aromas of prune, raisin and black plum are full and gritty. A chunky full-bodied palate feels grabby, while this tastes of generic blackberry, burnt coffee and dark chocolate. A steady plump, rubbery finish closes the show.Overt oak is the first thing you encounter on the nose, but underneath the heavy wood covering is a polished and sincere wine. The mouth is lively and juicy, with commendable plum and raspberry flavors. And while the finish is sort of basic in its vanilla and chocolate character, it has a nice feel to it. A wine with virtues but maybe a touch too much new oak.A bright purple luster draws you in, and the nose is bright, clean, focused and full of wild blackberry. Balanced in the mouth, with size and tannin but plenty of acidity and fruit. Tastes of blackberry, vanilla cream, molasses and spice, and the finish brings it on home. Sincere and excellent for the price.Smells like a can of green beans, or maybe it's canned peas. Either way, the nose is a siren call of what's to come: celery, acid, lime, asparagus and canned peas. No thank you.Jumpy and leathery at first, although time in the glass settles it down. The palate offers blackberry as the lead flavor, although there's some lemon peel and citrus in the background. Finishes simple and short.Even if this full-bodied Cab starts with some eggy, pastry-like aromas, it soon finds its form. The nose brings char and baked black fruit, while the palate is full of creamy blackberry and brown sugar flavors. Rather rich and ripe, with medium tannins and mild acidity. Drink sooner than later.Roasted berry aromas are stalky at first but come around. This feels round but only marginally structured. Creamy ripe generic flavors of berry and cherry finish solid with some heat.Aggressive lemon-lime aromas are itchy, and the nose turns grassy and green. Overactive in the mouth, and tough to hold on the palate. Just at the level of acceptable; warning signs have been posted.Crisp almost scratchy aromas of herbal red fruits are a bit strained. This feels solid, with ample volume. Earthy flavors of tomato sauce, mixed spices, stewed plum and cassis finish long and herbal, with some grace.A bit sweaty smelling, with pinched grapefruit aromas and distant citrus. The flavors say generic apple and lime, and there's a flatness to it. It's a little sugary as well. OK for a wine with pronounced low acidity.This is La Rural's top line, and before we've been a fan of the Malbec. But this wine has serious balance issues; it's acidic and sour at the core, with heavy oak and not enough flesh. Hails from the cooler Tupungato region, something that's evident in the wine's thin structure.Smells like raspberry or strawberry Kool-Aid, with appropriately “funky” flavors of rhubarb, raspberry and burnt sugar. The mouthfeel is rather scouring and acidic.Round and floral, with melon and other simple, clean aromas. Good mouthfeel, proper acidity and basic, likable flavors of citrus, green apple, green banana and tropical fruits make it a good quaffer and a good value.Tropical and zesty on the nose, with a big shot of lemon blossom and a secondary note of melon. The palate is juicy, fresh and sort of lean, with lemon, pineapple and green apple flavors. Arguably tart and angular, but at least it's clean and crisp.The nose is like a convention of all the food groups: there's bold fruit, grilled meat, cola and even some yeasty toast. The palate is juicy and hits with firm, lively blackberry and boysenberry flavors. And the finish offers continuity between the midpalate and end game. A very nice wine from a consistent winery.In the past this was a Bordeaux blend but now it's all or almost all Malbec. And because it hails from cooler Tupungato it features floral aromas more than heavy berry scents, and in the mouth it's all about red fruit as opposed to beefy black fruit. If it's a bit short on the finish, chalk that up to its racier, more streamlined frame.Dark and dense, with extracted black cherry, leather and earth aromas. Shows a ton of body and darkness but only limited flavors. Chocolate and vanilla appear on the finish, but there's also a blast of green to bring it down. Imported by North American Beverage Group.Heavily toasted and loaded with black cherry and blackberry aromas, this blend of Cabernet, Malbec and Petit Verdot pushes cola, chewy plum and black-fruit flavors. The back end is all about coffee, mocha and bitter chocolate, and as a whole this wine shows Argentina in a fine light. As for the winery, Chakana almost always gets it right.Tapiz's best wine to date, and the first one to shoot higher than the basic or reserve level. Aromas of fresh balsam wood, ripe blackberry and cola are clean and deep. Feels just right, with rich, rewarding flavors of molten berry, chocolate and coffee. Finishes warm, toasty and with focus. Has it all; drink now through 2015.This smells rubbery, with oaky spice, but airing allows it to expand across a lively palate. Herbal, spicy red-berry flavors are strongest in the midpalate, while peppery flavors, rubbery tannins and scratchiness define the finish.Smooth, earthy, lightly herbal aromas are balanced by fresh red-berry notes. This feels racy and lean in the mouth, with nothing fat or grabby getting in the way of steady raspberry, plum and herbal flavors. A note of olive and leafy green rises up on the finish.Generic black-fruit aromas are bolstered by chocolate and char, while the palate throws up extraripe cassis and blackberry flavors. The palate shows good acidity and ample body, and while the tannins come across hard on the finish, food will help it along.Red-fruit aromas of plum and berry are earthy and a bit stalky. The palate is tight, narrow and crisp more than flush. Spice, a touch of green herbs and then raspberry and plum flavors finish herbal, spicy and drying in feel.This appears light and rusty in the glass, with a distant aroma of floral cherry and not much more. It feels sheer and fresh, with fiery red-fruit flavors of cranberry and plum. Fades away with acidity and a juicy strawberry note.A well-made everyday Malbec that gets it done in all ways. Smells nice and floral, with bold, smooth berry aromas. The palate is fresh and lively, with juicy berry flavors, controlled creamy oak notes and spice. Clean on the finish, and a pleasure to drink.Heavily vegetal and unclean on the nose, then pickled on the palate, as in sauerkraut. The only thing saving this from the flusher is decent body weight and mouthfeel.After a few years of stumbling around in Mendoza, this Concha y Toro project seems to have found its way. This wine, albeit oaky, is full of dark fruit, dill and toast aromas. The palate is balanced and tight, with firm tannins and plenty of black cherry, plum and coffee flavors. Toasty and lasting. Shows a lot of power and purity.A little bit hickory-dominated on the bouquet, but also giving balsamic notes, blackberry and chocolate mint. The palate is linear due to a streak of cutting acidity, while the palate is also snappy with wild raspberry and bright plum flavors and plenty of wood tannin. A toasty finish with espresso and chocolate is fine and long. Drink now through 2017.Funky at first and simply not as smooth, pure and clean as Catena's Nicasia and Adrianna Malbecs, which are the components of this wine.

The palate is smooth, meaty, healthy and suave, with lush black fruit, prune and earthy flavors. Long, likable and showing a lot of depth and structure. Drink now through 2014.Chunky, ripe and fruity, with bacon and roasted berry aromas. The palate has a good feel and tannins that melt away, while the flavors of black cherry and cassis lean toward medicinal but don't fully go there. Bold like Malbec should be, with hints of rubber and latex on the finish.Lightly tropical on the nose, yet nutty and fading on the palate. There's some dried fruit flavors and some acidity to keep it hopping. But in the grand scheme of things this doesn't come close to taking over center stage.Dry, leafy, spicy aromas have a perfumed accent. A pushy, forward-feeling palate houses similar oaky flavors of cherry. On the finish, it turns woody, with resiny flavors and drawing tannins.A huge success given the price. Impeccably smooth on the bouquet, with clean yet generous berry aromas. Ripe and balanced, with bright berry and chocolaty oak flavors. Solid on the finish, with lasting plum and berry flavors.

The palate is big but choppy, and the finish is also thick and tannic. Definitely round and meaty, but slips to the stewy side.Dark and full-bodied, with a big bouquet of coconut, char and blackberry.

Feels rubbery and jammy, with stewed berry and herbal flavors.

A tasty, easy-to-drink wine with fine balance and fresh flavors of cherry, raspberry, cassis, chocolate and a medicinal finish. Good depth, length and size throughout. Delicious Malbec.Brambly and wild on the nose, this Cafayate Malbec features a narrow palate with edgy, briary plum and berry flavors. This seems riper with time in the glass, but all the way through it's pinchy in feel and ultimately ends with candied sweetness.Herbal and foresty up front, this Bordeaux blend smells of fig, caramel and berry fruits. Big, tannic and chunky on the palate, this has toasty, chocolaty, burnt flavors and a blackened finish. This offers a lot of power and fruit but it's brusk.For two years running this Torrontes is White Pearl's most praiseworthy wine. It is true and tasty, with flowery aromas leading to flavors of lychee, papaya, melon and grass. Decent body and length give it credibility as a 1.5L Best Buy.Full of red-fruit aromas, particularly plum and cherry. Feels raw, with wild berry, ample oak and a lot of acid-based tang to the palate. Lightly toasty, with a mild cherry flavor to the finish.Citric smelling, with floral notes and dampness. The palate is more thin and grating than expected, with red fruit, citrus, cherry sucking candy and graham cracker flavors.

There's not much structure or body here, but it's juicy and just tasty enough due to good candied berry and plum flavors. A regular but steady everyday Cab.Black in color, with a severe, jammy nose that's ominous and heavy. The look and bouquet portend the flavors, which are thick, raisiny and pruney. This is over-the-top heavy and extracted, with an inky outlook and subpar balance.Exemplary and exotic in the same breath. Aromas of sandalwood, spiced blueberry compote and fine leather make for an awesome bouquet. The palate is structured and huge like any top-end Argentine Malbec, but there's purpose and elegance as well. Tastes of integrated oak, black fruits, subtle herbs and spice. Textured, deep and toasty on the finish. Drink now through 2015.Clean and tropical, and not too heavy, oily or chunky. The nose is pure lemon, pear and apple, while the flavor profile revolves around citrus, apple and honey in the center. Finishes sweeter than it starts, but with dry papaya for balance. Good everyday Chardonnay from Argentina, something we don't see too often.Dark-berry aromas are crisp and show a note of minerality as well as barrel char.

Decent weight and feel help it along.Walnut, banana, apple and vanilla aromas are nicely presented. The palate holds its own as far as structure, while the melon, apple and honey flavors are friendly. This is a better-than-you'd-expect Chardonnay for everyday drinking.Broquel always offers a little more elegance and pedigree than most value Malbecs, and the 2005 has body, a silky feel and aromas and flavors of tobacco, baked blackberries and leather. It's a ripe, moderately tannic wine that's best for near-term drinking.Inky black in color, with a pretty nose defined by toast, minerality, stout plum and berry fruit. Round and vigorous in the mouth, with vibrant dark-berry flavors. A muscled-up wine from Salta with just enough finesse to balance everything out. Ready to drink.Lagarde regularly makes consistent, true wines and this Cab is compact, solid and smooth, with spice and a lot of berry fruit on the nose. Refined, deep and pure on the palate, with blackberry, marzipan and licorice flavors. Very nice Argentine Cabernet for the money. Drink now into 2011.Cherry and plum aromas carry the mildest touch of stem, yet the palate is reasonably stocky. Cherry and chocolate flavors may seem slightly confected, but given the wine's price it's hard to register many complaints. A creamy and flavorful finish makes this well worth the money.Fleshy peach, melon and pineapple aromas on the nose. Feels lifted and fresh, and decidedly not oaky, with citrusy orange and nectarine flavors. Fruity, round and easy on the finish.This opens with a blast of blueberry, sweet grass and baking spices.

Drink now–2016.Sweet haystack and banana aromas carry some smoke and burnt stalk, while the creamy, tropical palate shows pithy citrus fruit and sweet banana flavors. Tropical on the finish, but also slightly bitter. Solid by Mendoza standards but nothing special.Inky aromas of blueberry and boysenberry are a bit collapsed and reduced. Tannic and grabby in the mouth, this tastes of leathery plum and salt. And that saltiness carries onto the finish, which tastes briny and shows tannic grip.Smells resiny and a touch chemical, with cornflakes and vanilla bean notes. The palate is resiny and dusty, with sweet, candied, vanilla-infused flavors that crowd out any fruit that might want to make a stand.

It's concentrated and well integrated on the palate, with ultraripe and sweet flavors of coconut, vanilla cream and berry fruit. Seems a touch flat and candied on the finish, with a final blast of sweetness.Solid, sweet-styled Cab, this starts out with dark, piercing berry and asphalt aromas, which are followed by an appealing blast of dark-fruit flavors. Turns more aggressive and rugged as it opens, but stays the course.Dense and full of plum, spice, smoke and char.

Flavors are pure, modestly oaky and deep in terms of wild berry, coffee and chocolate.Dark, crusty aromas mix with sweet coconut on the nose, while the palate seems lactic and oaky despite fairly pointed acidity. Berry and plum flavors are entirely regular, and the finish is sharp due to the aforementioned acidity. A bit leafy tasting as well.Hard and spiky on the nose, and not a whole lot better in the mouth. The flavors are tart and juicy, while the lean finish is ultratangy and sharp.Granular and syrupy on the nose, and that same thickness of fruit is resurrected on the palate. Gritty on the finish, and sweet and lifeless as a whole.Dense and leathery on the nose, this has aromas of briary berries and a hint of corn/masa. It feels round and textured, with healthy tannins and chewy flavors of blackberry, roasted beef and herb.

This Bonarda is riper, softer and more cuddly than most, with ultraripe black-fruit flavors and soft tannins that make it borderline sappy. Plump, easygoing and loaded with fruit. Drink now to get the soft, giving side of this grape.Murky, stewy, soupy aromas deliver little to no freshness or fruit, while the palate is tannic and tastes bitter, mildly weedy and minty. Seems roasted and devoid of quality. Unclean and unimpressive.Plenty of patience is required with this wine, because at first it's rough and stewy, with herb and tomato aromas. Airing reveals a blackberry core and tannin-infused oak notes, while the finish features mostly char and vanilla. Has its merits but also some weaknesses.Floral and tropical aromas are a direct reflection of the 75% Torrontés in the blend. There's also lychee, another Torrontés byproduct. Otherwise, it's lean and tangy, with tangerine, lychee and green melon flavors. The more it opens the more it smells like a kitchen cleanser. But the forwardness and snap are admirable. Contains 15% Viognier and 10% Chardonnay.Tons of color, fruit and weight add up to a big, fun but clumsy hunk of generic red wine. With a slightly slick feel and not much structure, it's a wine that's meant to go down easy.Herbal black-fruit aromas come with a lot of oak. This is full, chunky and meaty in feel, with green hints and blackberry flavors appearing before a blast of hickory smoke takes over. A high-toast, slightly bitter finish confirms the strong oaky character.Among the new crop of Patagonian Malbecs, this wine shows a sly style. It's not that full of bells and whistles but it does offer plenty of ripe red fruit such as cassis, cherry and strawberry. Blended in are touches of tobacco and leather. Goes down smooth and easy; registers more lush and ripe than anything. Imported by S&F; Trading Company.Whether it's this single-vineyard Malbec or its partners below (Turcos or Tanos), the characteristics of each are nearly identical: creamy oak, tons of vanilla and milk chocolate, resiny mouthfeels and rich, sweet berry flavors. Pick one or pick them all; they are quasi interchangeable and only time will tell if they show individuality or remain identical triplets.Spicy and woody at first, with tons of black fruit. The nose shows a hint of dill, but for the most part the wine's pure and full of plum, blackberry, vanilla and good tannins. Firm and loaded, with cola on the finish. Yet another success in Trapiche's new line of old-vine, single-vineyard Malbecs. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.Aromas of pickled cabbage and cider are not too attractive, while the palate is surprisingly spritzy and tastes of sweet canned fruit, vanilla and oak dust.

The palate is round and a little soft and plump, with prune, fig and blackberry flavors. Sweet and easy throughout, with a mild finish. Nothing out of the ordinary.Creamy, bland and short on kick, aromas and flavors. The palate is spongey and tastes of creamed apple, light herbs and white pepper. It's inoffensive but not worth much attention. Finishes a bit vegetal as well.Noemía's signature Malbec, now in its third vintage, is one of the country's best. It starts out herbal and smoky, with a lot of dark French oak. The mouth is powerful and pure, with at least three layers of complex flavors and textures. The fruit is both subtle and loud. Simply an excellent wine of world-class character. Best in 2008–09.Light in color, with transparency, something you usually don't see with Malbec. The nose is rubbery, saucy and a touch grassy, while the palate is tannic and grabby, with stewy, rustic, roasted berry flavors. Finishes with the taste of barbecue sauce.Aromas of baked corn and citrus lead to a sharp, tangy palate that offers lemon and other citrus flavors, but not much heft or sweet fruit to balance things off. Thus it's a razor-sharp and edgy bubbly with lemony sourness all the way through the finish.This driving blend of Malbec with Syrah and Cabernet hails from Argentina's most northern vineyards.Bruising black plum and cassis aromas have mossy, floral sidenotes. It's grapy but not monotone, so you get boysenberry then spice flavors, especially clove.

The palate, meanwhile, runs a bit sweet, with boysenberry and plum. Soft on the back end, but with enough spine to see it through. For fans of bold reds.This reflects the big, modern style of Mendoza Malbec. The bouquet is ripe and hefty, with coconut, mint, blackberry and almond cookie aromas. Expect thick, rugged tannins along with toasty flavors of black coffee, chocolate and mint. A dark, fruity finish is more subtle and harmonious than specific. Drink through 2018.A rock-solid Malbec with attractive yet simple aromas of black cherry and raspberry. The palate is juicy and fresh, but with enough body to provide a sense of richnes.

Finishes full, with moderate intensity. A quaffing wine to drink now.Dark as night, with shoe polish, coconut and powerful black-fruit aromas. This is jammy, dense, soft and not for aging, but it does deliver a truck load of toasted coffee, blackberry, molasses and crisped brown sugar. Supersweet, rich and made to drink now.This Tempranillo is leafy and leathery, with light raspberry aromas backed by thin plum and berry flavors. It's an aggressive, standard red wine that's neither here nor there.Frenchman Bernard Magrez is building a global brand via high-quality, smartly named wines such as this (La Bienvenida means The Welcoming in Spanish). But the cuteness ends there; this is serious Malbec with maple, leather and coffee aromas in addition to rich berry scents. The palate is integrated and deep, with lively acidity and tannins but enough cuddly fruit to ensure balance. An excellent Argentinean debut for Monsieur Magrez. Imported by Bernard Magrez USA.Aromas of white grapefruit, celery and other prickly fruits lose steam with airing, while the green apple and lime flavors are solid and offer some sweetness. Wet in the mouth, which is what you want, but standard fare as a whole.On one hand you'll find bacon, rubber and smoke aromas, but on the other there's stem and murky notes that bring it down. The palate has sharp acidity and flavors of roasted red berries and pepper. For a Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend, it seems lean, stemmy and wanting.Nicely aromatic, with all that's good about affordable Malbec from Argentina: bold fruit, depth and some richness. The palate is plump and stocked with tasty blackberry, plum and raisin flavors, while the finish is sturdy and subtle. A good wine that should not offend anyone.Black fruit and a hint of tire rubber work the nose, and that's backed up by raspberry and sweet vanilla flavors. This wine is pretty good overall, with depth and push, but it's also a bit starchy and slightly green at its core.Powerfully oaked but awkward, with bruising aromas of fresh-cut wood, sawdust and campfire smoke. Amid the woodiness and thick body you'll find roasted plum and berry flavors, but on the finish resin reappears and lingers. Tastes too saucy and resiny to be called “clean.”Unus is 70% Malbec and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, but what you need to know is that it's 100% excellent. The nose features a rich blend of tobacco, baked plum and leather, while the palate is saturated, concentrated and tastes of cassis and blackberry. Clean, intense and complexHere's another success from Bodega Norton. The nose is rich and big, with crusty chocolate and coconut aromas. More chocolate blends with blackberry and pepper in the mouth, while on the finish there's sexy layered darkness. It's New World pomp and pleasantness in all its glory.Hot and rubbery on the nose, and while it doesn't smell bad it doesn't persuade you to go further. The palate has size, but it's not smooth as the acids dominate. And the flavors of berry and cherry are generic and almost impossible to identify as Syrah. Forgettable wine with tartness.Smells candied and gummy, with sweet, stewy red-berry aromas along with carob. The palate is fairly full and tannic, with cooked, herbal berry flavors that carry over onto the finish, which folds in coffee and grabby tannins. Good enough but sort of stewed and candied.Citrus, acacia blossom and patchouli oil give this an interesting and true-to-Cafayate bouquet. The palate delivers a shot of lychee fruit along with   tangerine and melon, with lemon meringue pie to finish. One of Argentina's better Torrontes; drink now.Complete but not overly exciting. The nose has Malbec's basic black fruit and spice components, while the palate is a little high in acidity and sharpness, but also shows buttery oak and blackberry fruit. Fruity but oaky, with some excess tart acidity on the finish.Lightly baked and sweet on the nose, which draws you in. The palate is brighter and more austere, with sheer, slightly bland cherry and raspberry flavors.

Good to average overall.Generic at best, with lemon and pool water aromas that aren't about to stir many smiles. The palate is flat almost to the point of mushy, with dull lychee and green apple flavors.An opening of lightly baked black fruit aromas and graham cracker is pleasant and ready, while the palate has size, a cushioned feel and herbal, spicy berry flavors and a swatch of oak on the back end. With oak and toast on the finish, it comes to a nice conclusion. Good Malbec with some pedigree.One of Altocedro's better efforts starts with meaty, ripe, chunky black fruit aromas and a wave of mocha, cocoa and berry syrup. It's a creamy specimen but has enough acidity and vitality to not run flat. Mocha, carob and plum extend through the finish. Drink now.Dark aromas suggest shoe polish and roasted black fruits. This feels rubbery and chunky, while the flavor profile includes quick pokes of cherry, plum and rubbery berry before a salty-tasting finish.Light and red in style, with food-friendly acidity and good overall balance and presence. Has sheer qualities and crisp fruit flavors, but it's not sour or too edgy. Smells like Pinot and tastes like it, too.Not bad for basic Argentine Chardonnay. The nose has banana and tropical fruit aromas to go with dried hay, while the soft-bodied palate has enough acidity to keep it flowing. Flavors of melon, banana and vanilla are solid even though it flattens out and shows mild bitterness on the finish.Earthy and deep from head to tail. The nose offers fresh compost, loamy berry, cola and overriding richness. Feels smooth and layered across the palate, with dark berry, pepper and bitter chocolate flavors. Blackened on the finish and toasty; 50% Malbec with four additional Bordeaux varieties.A bit jumbled and certainly it goes heavy on the oak. But as things settle you'll find buttery vanilla notes accenting relatively solid berry fruit. The end result is pretty good. Give it some air.Here's a crisp by-the-glass style of Pinot that's bringing good cherry and raspberry aromas, mild spice notes, and then a firm but lean body with plenty of acidity to propel crisp, cutting flavors of red plum and tart berry. Light and sheering but not sour or too thin.There aren't many Argentine Sauvignon Blancs that make a statement, so this is commendable for showing a lightly citric and minerally nose in front of fresh, citrusy flavors of lime, tangerine and grapefruit. More friendly and easygoing than intense or pungent, it fades quick and easy on the finish.Fairly herbal, with burnt briar aromas that cause it to tilt toward acrid. The palate shows mostly tart cranberry and wild berry flavors, and while it looks dark to the eye, the wine is surprisingly shallow and a little bit sharp in the end run.Brilliantly colored, with dynamite concentration and lovely black fruit and earthy aromas. Precise on the palate but also big and muscular, with silky tannins, grip and a late rush of deftly applied French oak. Delicious and a fine reflection of the Uco Valley, Argentina's top Malbec region.Clean and tropical, and not too heavy, oily or chunky. The nose is pure lemon, pear and apple, while the flavor profile revolves around citrus, apple and honey in the center. Finishes sweeter than it starts, but with dry papaya for balance. Good everyday Chardonnay from Argentina, something we don't see too often.Smoky and rubbery smelling, with brambly, mildly stemmy fruit aromas. The palate is plummy and red in character, with herbal raspberry on the back side. Dry, tangy and herbal on the finish; adequate at best as a whole, even at $9.Roasted and rubbery on first take, with aromas of leather, beefy blackberry and a pinch of herbal juniper and sharpness. The palate is racy and flows well, with lightly herbal flavors of red plum, raspberry and leather. Long on the finish, with a juicy feel.Heavily coated with coconut and oiled leather aromas, however, the palate recedes to Bonarda's typical angularity. The flavors of blackberry and cherry are solid, but the mouthfeel runs rough and sheer. And it finishes with some saltiness and leather. A good wine, not without its fault.Full and inviting up front, with hickory and leather in addition to dark-fruit aromas. This is a collaboration between two Italian buddies and the wine features black cherry and plum flavors but also rather grabby, heavy tannins. It's ultimately chewy and a bit hard, but still it's eminently satisfying.Heavy hayfield aromas are oxidized, and the flavors of almond peel, citrus pith and baked banana do nothing to impress. Not a fresh or healthy wine, if it ever was. Past its prime.A heady wine with mocha, chocolate, balsamic notes and black fruit on the bouquet. At first it seems thick and dumbed down, but it opens up to display bold berry flavors, stewed fruit, chocolate and savory accents. It's just lively enough, but overall this ranks as a saturated, bulky, round wine that falls squarely into the category of New World and ripe.Aggressive lemon-lime aromas are itchy, and the nose turns grassy and green. Overactive in the mouth, and tough to hold on the palate. Just at the level of acceptable; warning signs have been posted.Earth and leather aromas give it some personality, while violet, plum and blackberry form the base of the bouquet. The mouth is a touch rough and drying, but it houses both red and black fruit flavors along with chocolate. Lighter in weight than its Mendoza competition, but that's Patagonia in a nutshell.Basic cherry and raspberry aromas have a candied tone to them, yet the palate is zesty and tart, with linear raspberry flavors that are crisp and finish like a red-fruit sucking candy. A lot of acidity and not much body. Decent but stretched thin.Fairly dense on the nose, with aromas of coffee grounds, leather and beef stew along with berry fruit. The palate is true, with plum and brambly berry flavors. However, the feel is a bit choppy due to sharp acidity. A good blend that will do well with food.Jammy red-fruit aromas mixed with buttery oak make for a simple, sappy nose. There's more butter on the palate in addition to solid blackberry flavors. It finishes round but short, with yet another wave of barrel. A very good wine but not one that wows.Powerful but reduced, with gritty berry aromas and a ton of clove on the nose. There's a carry over of the clove in the mouth, and also roasted fruit flavors, wood spice and sweetness. Powerful for sure, but arguably a bit too woody for its own good.Big and purple, with ripe aromas of black fruits and bacon. The mouth is filling and full, with oaky blackberry, coffee and mildly roasted flavors. Turns more lush and soft on the finish, which is long and tastes of fig paste and prunes. Gets it done for the most part.Dark in color and that's backed up by deep earthy aromas and black fruit. In the mouth it's full and sweet, with baked fruit, chocolate and coffee flavors. Finishes with rich berry and molasses notes, and for a candied, sweet-styled Cabernet it gets the job done.Sol Huarpe's top wine, Xumek, has style and saucy sass. It's not just cookie-cutter ripe and rich, but instead shows herbs, mushroom and also ample black plum and berry flavors. In general it's nice for those seeking a touch more from their Argentinean Malbec. And it hails from lesser-known San Juan and not Mendoza, which may explain its unusual characteristics.Starts out smoky and seemingly ripe, but the nose is the best part. The palate, by contrast, is tight, gritty and the flavors are awkward at best. Really not that consistent and loses focus the more you get into it. Imported by Freixenet USA.Light, clean aromas of melon and vanilla are pleasant and don't overpower. The palate is lucid and medium in weight, with green melon and ripe apple flavors. Lime and green apple carry the finish. Works well; drink immediately.Big, lush and tightly structured, with cola and mocha aromas along with serious black fruit power and brightness. A pure and delicious Malbec-Cabernet wine with the full allotment of berry character, cola accents, dark spice and clarity. Drink now through 2014.Jammy and saturated, with ripe plum, berry and tar aromas. It's fairly sweet and hedonistic in the mouth, but with enough pulsing acidity to keep things in balance. Smoky, racy and juicy on the back palate; this is one of the better Salentein wines we've tried lately.Overtly floral and jumpy, with potent aromas of perfume. Heavy in the mouth, with odd, bland flavors of applesauce and spice. Soft and sticky.Opens with hard, rubbery, leathery aromas. In the mouth, it's thick and chewy with black fruit but also an herbal edge. There's depth and plenty of oak here, and it finishes sweet and relatively smooth. Starts rough, improves in the middle, and then finishes fairly well.This overoaked Malbec smells almost entirely of clove and chocolate. It's bulky and creamy in feel, with bland, stewy berry flavors and a blanket of oaky clove. Oak spice and heat control the finish.This Malbec-Tempranillo blend is trying to be one of those new-wave super bruisers and it achieves that goal, but only to a point. It's big, round, savory and lush, but it's shallow in the midsection because it lacks acidity and punch. Beefy but incomplete. Imported by Winesellers Ltd.From longtime Catena winemakers Mariano de Paola and Pepe Galante, this is a deep, black-fruited Malbec with a cushioned bouquet, violet notes and delightful blackberry character. The palate is deep, juicy, healthy and balanced, and the finish is smooth and offers a whiff of coconut. Solid, serious and good now through 2013.Cherry and mild leather aromas are inviting, while the medium-bodied palate, despite having some bite and edge, is topped off with cassis, cherry and light medicinal flavors. A bright wine with lively acidity and touches of oak, butter and vanilla on the finish.Gaseous, oily and flowery on the bouquet, with lemon and apple notes. Feels round and adequately acidic, with stalky, burnt flavors of lemon and melon. Short and rough on the finish.Sort of gaseous and touchy on the nose, with bramble and sweaty leather rising up once the bouquet opens. The palate offers a quick flash of berry fruit but nothing backing that up, and the finish is gone in seconds. Basically this is a light-bodied quaffer that seeks not to offend.Rhubarb and tomato leaf are strongly present on the nose, followed by grassy flavors and a hollow, thin mouthfeel. Septima is Spanish-owned, and this 800-case bottling seems like a nod to the homeland. But it tastes anything but Spanish.Over the years the Fantelli wines have not impressed, but this Torrontes works nicely, especially if you like some weight and sweetness to your white wine. The nose offers apple blossoms and honey, while the peach, pear and applesauce flavors are round and sweet. Seems to have some residual sugar.Full, dark and smoky on the nose, then juicy, tight and well built on the palate. Tastes good, with fast-moving black fruit and chocolate flavors fading quickly into a clean, moderate finish. Lively and tight for Malbec.Chunky and on the verge of overripe, with soft peach and melon aromas. Additional peach and melon flavors define the overweight palate, while the finish is heavy but flavorful. Tasty stuff with merits, but its lifespan is going to be short. Imported by 57 Main Street Wine Co.A little damp and heavy, with molasses, stewed berry and char on the nose. The palate, however, is fairly jumpy and alert; fiery berry flavors hit with force and some heat. On the finish you'll find berry essence and some bramble. Is it slightly green at its core? We think so. Imported by Southern Wine Group.Earthy aromas suggest red cabbage and olive more than bright, ripe berry.

Finishes a little pithy and mealy, with a final wave of muskiness.The wine is called 40 Barrels and every bit of those barrels is crawling on this Malbec-Cab blend.

Quite snappy and fresh, with an aggressive but true and correct finish.Too funky, animal and vegetal to recommend. The wine has color and size but the aromas and flavors just aren't that pleasant. Tastes more like rhubarb and carob than fresh berries.A big drop off from prior years, probably due to the cold harvest conditions of 2008. Smells minty and lactic, with hard spice and distant fruit aromas. Feels closed, tannic and clipped, with narrow berry flavors and green notes. Toasty on the finish, but also clacky feeling. Good relative to other wines, but not at $70.Fairly brambly and a little sour on the bouquet, with prickly fruit aromas. The palate is just as sharp and angular, without much cushion to fall back on. Flavors of cherry and raspberry are slightly herbal and tart, while the finish is more of the same. Not as round and ripe as you'd expect for an $18 Malbec.This new wine from Donald Hess of the Hess Collection is a big, bold mix of black cherry and currants. It's ripe and cushioned by full tannins and a lot of spirit. The blend is 66% Malbec, 20% Cabernet and 14% Tannat from high-altitude vineyards in Salta. Will go nicely with steak and other meat dishes. A truly excellent, modern-styled Argentine red.Full and fruity, with a dusty edge to the nose and accents of black pepper. Fairly thick and textured on the palate, with a freshness of fruit that works well on the palate. Blackberry, licorice and floral elements all add to the wine's appeal.Dark and heavily oaked on first blush, but give it time to unwind or let it sit in the bottle for a year or two and this will satisfy any Malbec lover. Early on, it's dense and full of shoe polish, mint and coconut; later it spreads out to show sweet dark-berry flavors and finally a rich, almost sticky finish of woodspice, brown sugar and lushness.Exotic aromas of wild berries, cumin and other Middle Eastern spices are interesting and inviting. This feels thick and chewy, bordering on syrupy, with stewed plum and brown sugar flavors. It hits with some burn and heat on the bullish finish.Leather, dark fruit and citrus peel make for a good nose, while the palate is meaty and a bit heavy as it pours on those classic dark-fruit flavors that Malbec is known for. Best to get at this one now because neither the palate nor the finish shows much acidity. A touch hollow.Earthy and mildly lactic on the nose, with tight, lean, herbal flavors. Doesn't rise above mediocre.This is heady but flat on the nose, with soft, oak-driven aromas of baked apple and toffee. It feels plump yet alive due to good acidity, while the flavor profile is steered by the barrel, leaving notes of toasty apple and walnut. A good wine but one that really piles on the oak and resin.There's a sweet center to the bouquet, but surrounding it are more complex notes of mushroom, rubber and roast meat. The palate features ripe, clean blackberry and cassis flavors, while the finish shows piercing tannins. Shows some weight and tannic build-up at this point; drink now and into '09.Wines like this have defined and propelled Malbec mania. It's ripe, bold and firm, with welcoming berry aromas and a powerful but healthy palate of ripped black cherry, berry and cola flavors. In the mix and on the finish you'll find coffee and mocha. Drink now and over the next two years.Warm and earthy, with a touch of sulfur that subsides with air. The palate is juicy but also sort of rich, and the flavors of mixed red fruits feature a couple of layers of potency that are followed by a compact, medium-length finish.If the color doesn't tell the full story, the nose will: it's impeccably perfumed, round and sweet, with amazing fruit aromas and a toasty background. The feel is as lush and rich as they come, and there's outstanding purity to the lusty black fruit flavors. A masher with elegance. Maybe the best Malbec Argentina has ever produced. Drink from 2011–15.Hot and earthy up front, with mocha-like aromas. The palate and finish are syrupy, and the wine ends in a pool of chocolate and berry extract. This is an example of why Argentine Syrah has not found its groove.Aromas of apple cider are a touch acrid, while the palate is wet and easy but low in acidity. Flavors of melon and white fruits show some bitterness and break up in front of a flat finish.Smells murky, leafy and of compost. The palate is lean, dry and slightly rough, with green herb, tomato and light raspberry and strawberry flavors. Finishes herbal and tea-like, with more earthiness than clarity.Clos de los Siete, the amalgmated product of Michel Rolland's Uco Valley wine commune, is rich, round and ripe, with deep aromas and trimmings like polished oak and minerality. The wine is proper, medium to full in size, and full of blackberry, plum and cocoa. No hiccups, pure fruit and complexity make this stellar for the price.Buttercup and lemon aromas may not be overpowering but they are true to the variety. The flavors of melon and preserved tropical fruits work on the wine's fuller-bodied, almost creamy frame. Finishes warm but peachy, with an oily texture. Drink right away.The nose kicks off with ripe apple and zest and draws you in. The palate is live-wire pineapple and green apple with plenty of tang and a worthy mouthfeel. Even on the finish it holds the line.This is prickly and spicy on first take, followed by an aromatic wave of ripe berry and tobacco. It feels jammy and almost heavy, with creamy, milkshake flavors of blackberry, vanilla and cream, and a warm, Port-like finish. A blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot and 20%; drink now–2014.Starts out murky and sweaty, before showing cola, green herbs and leather. It's a rather jumpy, scattershot wine with plum and boysenberry flavors and a grapy, flush finish. The feeling here is that Terrazas wines were more consistent and elevated a few years ago.Slightly carbonic and gassy at first, with huge candied fruit aromas. But quickly the wine settles, and out comes sweet blackberry flavors and some gumminess. It's a chunky, easy wine with medium tannins and modest plushness, which is something you shouldn't necessarily expect from a value-positioned wine. Short on the finish, but plump and buttery.Strange smelling, with aromas of exotic spices, blueberry and some other notes that don't come across that well. Feels solid and chunky, with herbal, sweet flavors that culminate in a dry, rubbery, herbal-tasting finish.By far the best wine in the El Fogón lineup is this Torrontes. The nose is clean and harmonious, with light flower blossom scents. A citrusy mix blends with both apple and pear fruit on the palate, and the finish is clean, if a bit sweet (residual sugar?). Drink as soon as possible.Jammy and raisiny on the nose, but it also has fresh black-fruit and mocha notes that prevent the nose from seeming soft. This feels concentrated and jammy, with maple, mocha, blackberry and oak-influenced flavors. The rich, oak-driven finish shows even more notes of mocha, coffee and chocolate. Candy in a glass, but with structure.Lightly candied at first, but airing unveils more pure plum and raspberry aromas. Cherry, raspberry and plum flavors are standard but good, while the mouthfeel is firm and smooth enough. Mainstream all the way but likable.Opens with apple and buttercup aromas that are encouraging, but the palate falls off. It's wet but shows no definition or fruit. Creamy and generic in the mouth, and ultimately it doesn't go anywhere besides being plump and loaded with vanilla.Bright purple in color, a sure indicator that what's to come will be jammy and rich. The nose is all boysenberry and wood, with a hint of mineral. The palate is ultraripe but a bit clumsy and oversized. Not complex but very nice in a fruit-forward, knife-and-fork manner.Warm and earthy, with a touch of sulfur that subsides with air. The palate is juicy but also sort of rich, and the flavors of mixed red fruits feature a couple of layers of potency that are followed by a compact, medium-length finish.A touch cooked and oaky, but with a sweet, friendly side, too. The palate rests on beefy fruit, and it's chewable and just slightly herbal in nature. Finishes leathery and tannic, with chocolate and coffee notes. Imported by Pernod Ricard, USA.Deep, lush aromas of black fruits, graphite and coconut are welcoming and friendly. The mouthfeel is pure and smooth, with elegance and power. Flavors of cassis, blackberry, hard spices and licorice filter into a long, mellow, classy finish. This is a pushy, full-bodied wine that doesn't throw punches; drink through 2020.Full and overly chunky, but ultimately off-kilter. Too sweet and gummy.A hot and fiery wine from San Juan province that mixes stewy barnyard aromas with black cherry. The palate has a syrupy, sugary feel and medicinal, creamy, baked berry flavors. Peppery on the finish, but with a medicinal aftertaste.From La Rioja, this Torrontés is quiet and neutral. It offers a little tangerine on the nose, and then acceptable but unexciting banana and pear flavors. Overall it's decent but bland.Raisiny aromas lack freshness and lift. Following that lead, this Cabernet feels stewy and heavy, with questionable balance. Herbal flavors of stewed plum and tomato finish chunky and choppy.A wine that's seriously muscled up with tannin and oak. That's what you get with this rugged Argentinean Cabernet that comes with leafy notes of tobacco and mint along with raspy, grippy berry fruit. Maybe another year in bottle will help; now it's not that pleasant.Light, semisweet aromas of cherry show a modest level of concentration, while the palate is a bit rubbery and delivers good but regular cola and cassis flavors. There's a wave of milk chocolate to the fairly smooth but basic finish, and overall it's fine but doesn't get you excited. Only 250 cases made. to numeric"
